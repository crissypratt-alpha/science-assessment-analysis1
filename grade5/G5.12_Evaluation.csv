Alpha Standardized Science G5.12,7,"Soil and Water Soil is made of tiny rock pieces, water, air, and dead plants. Different soils hold different amounts of water. Some soils can hold more water than others, just like different sponges can hold different amounts of water. When soil holds water, we call this ""water retention."" Soils with smaller particles (like clay) can hold more water because there are smaller spaces between particles that trap water. Soils with larger particles (like sand) let water pass through quickly. Plants need water from soil to grow, so the amount of water soil can hold is important. Types of Soil We Learned About: Sand has large particles that feel rough when you touch it. It is light colored. Clay has very small particles that feel smooth. It has a brownish color.
