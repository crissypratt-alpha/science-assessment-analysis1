Alpha Standardized Science G5.9,10,"Read the passage again to answer the following question. Will and Zach came home from school and were hungry. They decided to fix a snack but soon realized that they had eaten all the snacks, so now they had to cook! They found a box of white cake mix and all the ingredients. Zach cracked two eggs in the bowl. Will tore open the box of cake mix. After pouring all the ingredients in the bowl, the new mixture was stirred 50 times. Last, they poured the white cake mix into the pan. The oven was heated up, and the boys put the cake in the oven. Will and Zach went to play video games and almost forgot about the cake until they heard the timer got off. They pulled the cake out of the oven. The cake is a golden brown. However, the edges were just a little bit burned. The burned edges made the house smell. The boys struck a match to light a candle. They did not want the house to smell bad. After the cake cooled off, the boys cut slices of the cake to eat. The boys ate and digested the cake until they were full. Zach was thirsty so he went to the kitchen. He placed ice into his cup and poured the Sprite. Zach could not drink it at first. The Sprite always fizzes too much. They cleaned up their mess using Clorox wipes.
