A B C D Use the information about zebra mussels and your knowledge of science to answer the questions. Zebra Mussels Zebra mussels are small shellfish that are normally found in Eastern Europe. This species was first observed in the Great Lakes area of North America in the 1980s, likely as a result of the zebra mussels attaching to the sides of ships. Zebra mussels reproduce very rapidly in their five- year lifespan. A single zebra mussel can produce five million eggs, with 100,000 of those eggs potentially reaching adulthood. Their main diet is algae and plankton, which can have a large impact on other organisms in the food web Figure 1 shows the relative sizes of zebra mussels compared to a small coin. Zebra mussels can spread into new bodies of water by attaching to the sides of ships. They can then spread throughout nearby waterways on they start reproducing. This makes zebra mussels extremely difficult to remove from an ecosystem once they are introduced. One example of a waterway system where this has happened is in the Great Lakes. Graph 1 shows the growth of zebra mussels in different bodies of water in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota between 1990 and 2005. Many of these bodies of water throughout the three states are connected to the Great Lakes where zebra mussels were first observed. Figure 2 shows the impact that zebra mussels have on the flow of energy and matter in Lake Michigan. In ecosystems without zebra mussels, most of the energy flows from algae and plankton to fish. Once zebra mussels spread to an ecosystem, most of the energy then flows from algae and plankton directly to the zebra mussels. The figure also shows what percentage of the total ecosystem's mass each organism group makes up. Lake Tahoe is one of the largest freshwater lakes in the United States. A new program recently started in the Lake Tahoe area that is being used to monitor for zebra mussels. The water in Lake Tahoe must be kept as clean as possible to help when inspecting the water for the presence of zebra mussels.

He was curious about the telegraph, the new Atlantic cable, and the wireless, which was a new technology at that time for storm tracking and forecasting. These instruments provided new ways of observing and sharing observations with other scientists. He also used kites, balloons, and hot-air balloons to study the upper atmosphere. These were great advances in technology for Wegener. Drifting Continents and Land Bridges Soon after earning his doctorate, Wegener noticed how the continents of South America and Africa seemed to fit together like a puzzle as shown below. This observation led him to develop his hypothesis of continental drift. Wegener was not the first to make such observations. The prevailing story was that the two continents had once been connected by a continent-sized land bridge that had long ago sunk to the seafloor. Wegener believed if that were true, the land bridge would have bobbed to the surface, because he knew that land sinks under the weight of a glacier and rises again after the glacier recedes. The Origin of Continents and Oceans Between expeditions and becoming an accomplished meteorologist, Wegener worked on his hypothesis of continental drift. In 1915 he published his book on the subject, The Origin of Continents and Oceans. He began the book by pointing out the possibility of continental drift and went on to explain that whatever force caused the continents to move also caused mountain ranges to form when continents collided. Evidence, Rejection, and Acceptance Wegener cited evidence supporting his hypothesis—identical fossils came from widely separated places. Mountain ranges would interlock if the continents were placed together. Other scientists were outraged. Instead of reacting with curiosity, they attacked Wegener mercilessly. Eventually, because of several discoveries in paleomagnetism and oceanography in the 1950s, scientists became convinced that continents move.
