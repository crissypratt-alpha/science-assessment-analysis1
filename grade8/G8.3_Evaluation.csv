Many tourists come to see Azure Reef, and Azure Island’s residents earn money from these visitors. But as tourism has increased, more boats have started anchoring over the reef. The boats’ anchors have hit and damaged corals. Algae often grows over damaged corals. Scientists on Azure Island have projected that if nothing is done to stop anchor damage, most of Azure Reef will eventually be covered with algae. If this happens, the reef will lose biodiversity, which means it will have fewer species. The residents of Azure Island will also lose important ecosystem services, such as money from tourism. The Azure Island Government Council has the job of finding a solution to the coral damage problem. However, finding the best solution is not easy.
