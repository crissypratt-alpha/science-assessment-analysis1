Alpha Standardized Science G8.10,25,"Over the past 50 years, the coastal city of Oceanview has experienced significant changes due to rapid population growth and increased per-capita consumption of natural resources. In 1970, Oceanview was a small town of 50,000 people surrounded by lush forests and expansive wetlands. Residents enjoyed clean air, abundant freshwater from nearby springs, and low energy consumption. By 1995, the population had doubled to 100,000 residents. This growth led to the clearing of forests for new housing developments and shopping centers. The city's water treatment plant was expanded to meet the growing demand, and energy consumption rose as more homes and businesses were built. The increased use of automobiles and industrial activities began to affect air quality. By 2020, Oceanview had become a bustling city of 200,000 people. The once-abundant forests had been largely replaced by urban development, and the wetlands had been reduced by nearly half, leading to a loss of natural flood barriers and wildlife habitats. Daily water consumption had increased sixfold compared to 1970 levels, straining local freshwater sources. The city's annual energy use had grown dramatically, necessitating the construction of a new fossil fuel power plant. These changes brought economic prosperity but also presented environmental challenges. The reduction in forest cover led to higher urban temperatures and decreased air quality due to increased emissions. The shrinking wetlands resulted in more frequent and severe flooding during storms. Local wildlife populations declined as their habitats were altered or destroyed. The heightened energy consumption contributed to greater greenhouse gas emissions, impacting global climate systems. Concerned about the long-term sustainability of the city, the mayor of Oceanview has requested a report on how the increase in population and per-capita resource consumption has impacted Earth's systems over the past 50 years. Based on the information provided, which argument is best supported by evidence regarding how the increase in Oceanview's population and per-capita resource consumption has impacted Earth's systems?",None,MC,"A) The city's growth has led to economic prosperity that offsets any negative environmental impacts on Earth's systems., B) The increase in population and resource consumption has strained Earth's systems by degrading natural habitats and increasing pollution., C) Technological advancements in Oceanview have successfully minimized environmental impacts despite population growth., D) The expansion of Oceanview has improved Earth's systems by replacing inefficient natural areas with developed land.
