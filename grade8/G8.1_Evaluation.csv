Selection of Favorable Traits in the Peppered Moth The distribution of traits in a population is affected by natural selection. As a result, organisms with advantageous traits have a greater likelihood of survival. For example in the peppered moth Biston betularia, two patterns of coloration are observed. The 'typica' form of the moth is light colored, while the 'carbonaria' form of the moth is dark colored. The genetic basis for the difference in the color of the moths are the 'typica' and 'carbonaria' alleles. In peppered moths, the allele for dark-bodied moths (carbonaria) is dominant, while the allele for light-bodied moths (typical) is recessive. The external environment directly influences the distribution of the two variants of the trait in the population of moths. This is due to the fact that the color of the moth determines its success in escaping predators by camouflaging itself against tree trunks. Predators are less likely to spot and eat moths that are well camouflaged. As a result, these moths survive and reproduce. This also implies that the presence or absence of predators also influences the trait distribution in peppered moths. The image shows the two variants of the moth on a tree trunk. After industrialization, there was an increase in the levels of air pollution. This resulted in light colored tree trunks getting covered by soot and becoming dark in color.

Alpha Standardized Science G8.1,39,"Answer the following questions after reading this passage. Selection of Favorable Traits in the Peppered Moth The distribution of traits in a population is affected by natural selection. As a result, organisms with advantageous traits have a greater likelihood of survival. For example in the peppered moth Biston betularia, two patterns of coloration are observed. The 'typica' form of the moth is light colored, while the 'carbonaria' form of the moth is dark colored. The genetic basis for the difference in the color of the moths are the 'typica' and 'carbonaria' alleles. In peppered moths, the allele for dark-bodied moths (carbonaria) is dominant, while the allele for light-bodied moths (typical) is recessive. The external environment directly influences the distribution of the two variants of the trait in the population of moths. This is due to the fact that the color of the moth determines its success in escaping predators by camouflaging itself against tree trunks. Predators are less likely to spot and eat moths that are well camouflaged. As a result, these moths survive and reproduce. This also implies that the presence or absence of predators also influences the trait distribution in peppered moths. The image shows the two variants of the moth on a tree trunk. After industrialization, there was an increase in the levels of air pollution. This resulted in light colored tree trunks getting covered by soot and becoming dark in color.

Like many plants, field mustard reproduces by making flowers that then make seeds. Flowering time is the amount of time between when the plant begins to grow and when it starts to make flowers. In good weather, plants may benefit from longer flowering times. Plants with longer flowering times can gather more resources and produce more seeds. In harsh, dry weather such as droughts, plants may benefit from shorter flowering times. Plants with shorter flowering times are less likely to run out of resources or die before they can produce seeds. The table below describes a possible population of field mustard plants at the start of a period of time and at the end of that period. The table shows flowering time measurements for a representative sample of the population at the start and for another representative sample at the end. Complete the table.
