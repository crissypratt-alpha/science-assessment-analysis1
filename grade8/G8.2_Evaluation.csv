Answer the question after reading this passage. Selection of Favorable Traits in the Peppered Moth The distribution of traits in a population is affected by natural selection. As a result, organisms with advantageous traits have a greater likelihood of survival. For example in the peppered moth Biston betularia, two patterns of coloration are observed. The 'typica' form of the moth is light colored, while the 'carbonaria' form of the moth is dark colored. The genetic basis for the difference in the color of the moths are the 'typica' and 'carbonaria' alleles. In peppered moths, the allele for dark-bodied moths (carbonaria) is dominant, while the allele for light-bodied moths (typical) is recessive. The external environment directly influences the distribution of the two variants of the trait in the population of moths. This is due to the fact that the color of the moth determines its success in escaping predators by camouflaging itself against tree trunks. Predators are less likely to spot and eat moths that are well camouflaged. As a result, these moths survive and reproduce. This also implies that the presence or absence of predators also influences the trait distribution in peppered moths. The image shows the two variants of the moth on a tree trunk. After industrialization, there was an increase in the levels of air pollution. This resulted in light colored tree trunks getting covered by soot and becoming dark in color.
