Read the passage below and answer question 5 Selection of Favorable Traits in the Peppered Moth The distribution of traits in a population is affected by natural selection. As a result, organisms with advantageous traits have a greater likelihood of survival. For example, in the peppered moth Biston betularia, two patterns of coloration are observed. The 'typica' form of the moth is light-colored, while the 'carbonaria' form of the moth is dark-colored. The genetic basis for the difference in the color of the moths is the 'typica' and 'carbonaria' alleles. In peppered moths, the allele for dark-bodied moths (carbonaria) is dominant, while the allele for light-bodied moths (typical) is recessive. The external environment directly influences the distribution of the two variants of the trait in the population of moths. This is due to the fact that the color of the moth determines its success in escaping predators by camouflaging itself against tree trunks. Predators are less likely to spot and eat moths that are well-camouflaged. As a result, these moths survive and reproduce. This also implies that the presence or absence of predators also influences the trait distribution in peppered moths. The image shows the two variants of the moth on a tree trunk. After industrialization, there was an increase in the levels of air pollution. This resulted in light-colored tree trunks getting covered by soot and becoming dark in color. The table shows how this affected the peppered moth populations over a period of time. 1800 1850 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975 Typica 100 97 90 65 21 10 7 Carbonaria 0 3 10 35 79 90 93 The graph shows the change in the percentage of dark-colored peppered moths in the region after the year 1975.",C,8,,3,Real-world scenario with visual component provides some context for reasoning.,3,Requires constructing explanations or engaging in argumentation.,2,DCI present but used at surface level — identification rather than reasoning.,1,"No CCC engagement.

Use the information in the passage below and your knowledge of science to answer question 24. Kit Fox Ecology The San Joaquin kit fox is a small fox, about the size of a house cat. It is native to the San Joaquin Valley, which is the southern part of California's Central Valley. Table 1 shows some characteristics of San Joaquin kit foxes. In the 1800s, the San Joaquin Valley of California was mostly open grassland and marshes with a few sparsely wooded areas. Today, humans have changed much of the Central Valley for agricultural and urban use. Figure 1 shows the results of a study about how a portion of Fresno County in the Central Valley changed over time. These changes in the Central Valley led to a decline in the San Joaquin kit fox population, and the species was placed on the endangered species list in 1967. In addition to the changes in land use in the Central Valley, kit foxes are threatened by other factors, such as climate change and predators. Scientists have noted that as the San Joaquin kit fox population has declined, the populations of some of its predators, such as coyotes, have increased. The outlook for the kit fox is poor unless serious human intervention occurs. The human population in the Central Valley is expected to grow over the next two decades. The added pressure of more people could possibly create an even worse situation for the remaining population of kit foxes. Humans have been trying to save kit foxes for decades.
