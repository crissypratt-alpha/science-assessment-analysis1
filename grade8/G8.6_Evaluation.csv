Read the following and answer the Questions. Passage 1 The Unexpected Effects of Wolves in Yellowstone National Park In the 1920s, wolves were officially removed from Yellowstone National Park. Wolves are predators that occasionally prey on domesticated animals, and people were afraid that they might also harm humans. They used hunting and other methods to remove all of the wolves from Yellowstone. By the 1990s, the Yellowstone ecosystem had significantly changed. One major difference was the reduction of aspen, cottonwood, and willow trees growing along streams. Yellowstone was experiencing a drought, and without any wolves to prey on elk, the elk population was at its highest level. Elk eat young trees and shrubs, especially in winter when the snow covers up shorter plants. During this period, nearly all of the young trees were eaten by elk before they could grow to maturity. This loss affected many animals, including the birds that nest in trees, the bison that compete with elk for the young trees, and the beavers that use the trees as a source of food and shelter. In 1995 and 1996, a total of 21 wolves were released into Yellowstone. Since then, scientists have been recording observations in the Yellowstone ecosystem. For example, they observed wolves often eating only about half of a prey animal and the rest of the animal was then eaten by scavengers. Scientists also observed more young trees and shrubs growing to maturity.

The chart shows information about how traits of ancestors of the modern horse have changed. People such as farmers and scientists can affect the traits of organisms, including horses, cattle, and corn. Fossil evidence supports the idea that modern corn, also known as maize, is a descendent of teosinte plants. Over time, people chose to plant teosinte seeds from the larger and more productive plants. The size and number of kernels produced in each generation increased and, over thousands of years of breeding, resulted in modern corn plants. Modern cattle are often bred for traits such as high milk production, muscle growth, and small or no horns. Aurochs are one of the earlier cattle species and are ancestors of many modern cattle species. Aurochs were large cattle with long horns, fed on grasses and other plants, and lived in grassland habitats of Europe and Asia.

Use the information about glowing jellyfish and your knowledge of science to answer the questions. Glowing Jellyfish Jellyfish and comb jellies have existed in both cold and warm ocean water for more than 500 million years. These two types of organisms have many similar features even though jellyfish and comb jellies are not closely related. Some jellyfish and comb jellies can even produce and emit light, as shown in Photograph 1. These organisms glow because of a process known as bioluminescence. During this process, a chemical reaction produces light energy that the organism can then emit. A substance known as a luciferase helps a luciferin molecule release this light energy as it reacts with oxygen. In some comb jellies, this chemical reaction is activated when calcium is present. The bioluminescence chemical reaction is shown in Figure 1. Bioluminescence can occur in different ways, depending on the organism, but a few factors are common to all bioluminescent organisms. For example, oxygen is a reactant that is always needed. This element is absorbed through the thin cell membranes of the organism. Table 1 summarizes how bioluminescence can be used in different ways. Scientists are studying the genes needed for bioluminescence in comb jellies. In one experiment, a researcher injected the DNA needed for bioluminescence into eight rabbit embryos. The embryos were then placed back inside the mother, where they developed normally. When the eight rabbits were born, it was found that two of them had the ability to bioluminesce.

A B C D Use the information about tsunamis and the Louisiana coast and your knowledge of science to answer the questions. Tsunamis and the Louisiana Coast Scientists recently discovered evidence for an underwater landslide that occurred in the Mississippi Canyon about 7,000 years ago. The undersea canyon is located on the seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico just south of Louisiana. A scar in the canyon suggests that the landslide happened about 50 miles southwest of the Mississippi River outlet. The Mississippi Canyon landslide zone is shown in Map 1. During the landslide, Earth materials from the canyon's upper slope likely broke free and slid down the slope of the canyon until the Earth materials spread out and slowed down. The movement of this material on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico resulted in a tsunami that eventually reached the Louisiana coast.",Diagram/image referenced in question,MC,"A) tsunami usually forms when an event such as a sudden shift in the seafloor, a landslide, or volcanic activity releases a large amount of energy underwater. This causes a large wave to form on the surface. The wave is pulled back down by Earth's gravity and then splits into smaller waves that move outward in all directions. These waves can build to heights of 20 meters before reaching the shoreline. Figure 1 shows how a typical tsunami forms. The National Tsunami Warning System has a network of sensors to detect underwater events such as landslides and earthquakes. More recently, the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART®) system was developed, as shown in Figure 2. In this system, each sensor has a sensitive pressure recorder on the ocean floor to monitor small changes in water pressure. Any changes in pressure are sent to an anchored flotation device known as a buoy. The data is then sent to a satellite. Data from these events is used to make predictions about tsunamis and provide warnings in coastal areas. Tsunami warning maps can be generated within minutes of an underwater event using the DART system and computer modeling.
