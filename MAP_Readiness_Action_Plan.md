# MAP Science Readiness Action Plan
## Alpha School -- Grades 3-8

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive gap analysis comparing Alpha School's current science testing and curriculum against the NGSS Performance Expectations assessed by the MAP Science test (Grades 3-8). The analysis identifies:

1. **Testing Gaps**: NGSS standards that MAP assesses but Alpha does not currently test
2. **Curriculum Gaps**: NGSS standards that MAP assesses but Alpha's curriculum (MobyMax for G3-5, Nice Academy for G6-8) does not adequately cover
3. **Student Struggle Areas**: Standards where students score below 75% accuracy, indicating the need for reteaching or additional practice
4. **Specific Remediation Actions**: Ready-to-use test questions and lesson descriptions to close every identified gap

**Key Findings Across All Grades:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total MAP NGSS Standards (G3-8) | 228 |
| Standards Currently Tested by Alpha | 124 |
| Testing Gaps (MAP tests, Alpha does not) | 104 |
| Standards Below 75% Student Accuracy | 36 |

**Priority Actions:**
- Add missing test questions for untested NGSS standards (see Section 3 for each grade)
- Develop or strengthen curriculum lessons for uncovered standards (see Section 4 for each grade)
- Implement targeted reteaching for standards where students score below 75% (see Section 5 for each grade)
