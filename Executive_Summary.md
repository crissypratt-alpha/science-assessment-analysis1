# Executive Summary: MAP Science Readiness Gap Analysis
## Alpha School — Grades 3-8

---

## Purpose

This executive summary synthesizes a comprehensive analysis of the gaps between:

1. **What MAP tests** — The 228 NGSS Performance Expectations assessed by the MAP Science exam across Grades 3-8
2. **What we test** — Alpha School's end-of-grade mastery tests (83 tests across 6 grade levels, totaling 2,700+ questions)
3. **What we teach** — Alpha's science curriculum (MobyMax for G3-5; Nice Academy/Khan Academy for G6-8)

The goal: identify exactly where Alpha's testing and teaching fall short of MAP expectations, and provide a specific, actionable fix list for each grade level.

## The Big Picture

| Metric | G3 | G4 | G5 | G6 | G7 | G8 | **Total** |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----------|
| NGSS Standards MAP Tests | 18 | 17 | 16 | 59 | 59 | 59 | **228** |
| Standards We Test | 18 | 12 | 13 | 20 | 31 | 30 | **124** |
| **Testing Gaps** | **0** | **5** | **3** | **39** | **28** | **29** | **104** |
| Testing Coverage % | 100% | 71% | 81% | 34% | 53% | 51% | **54%** |
| Standards We Fully Teach | 14 | 8 | 12 | 12 | 8 | 9 | **63** |
| Standards Weakly Taught | 4 | 2 | 2 | 32 | 37 | 35 | **112** |
| **Not Taught at All** | **2** | **4** | **2** | **11** | **9** | **10** | **38** |
| Standards Below 75% Accuracy | 4 | 6 | 2 | 5 | 9 | 11 | **37** |
| Tests to Fix (add questions) | 0 | 5 | 3 | 39 | 28 | 29 | **104** |
| Lessons to Add/Fix | 6 | 6 | 4 | 43 | 41 | 45 | **145** |

### Key Takeaways

- **Alpha tests only 54% of what MAP expects.** 104 of 228 NGSS standards have zero questions on our mastery tests.
- **The gap is concentrated in middle school.** Grades 3-5 are in relatively good shape (71-100% coverage). Grades 6-8 cover only 34-53% of MAP standards.
- **Engineering/Technology (ETS) is a blind spot across every grade.** ETS standards are completely untested in Grades 4-8 and untaught in Grades 4-8.
- **The curriculum gap mirrors the testing gap.** Of the 104 untested standards, only 38 lack curriculum entirely — but 112 have only weak/tangential coverage that won't prepare students for MAP's three-dimensional assessment style.
- **37 standards show student accuracy below 75%**, meaning students are being taught and tested but aren't mastering the material.

| Strengthen | 5-PS2-1 | Gravity Pulls Things Down | G5 Physical Science > Forces and Motion |

### Grade 6 — 43 lessons to add or strengthen
**Platform:** Nice Academy (Khan Academy)

**11 completely NEW lessons needed:**

| Standard | Lesson | Placement |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| MS-ESS1-3 | Scale of the Solar System | MS Earth and Space > Earth in space |
| MS-ESS2-2 | Geoscience Processes and Earth's Surface | To be developed |
| MS-ESS3-2 | Natural Hazard Forecasting | To be developed |

**32 existing lessons need strengthening** — particularly in Physical Science (forces, energy, waves) and Life Science (genetics, evolution, ecosystems). The current Nice Academy content provides tangential video/article coverage but does not align to the three-dimensional NGSS assessment style that MAP uses.

### Grade 7 — 41 lessons to add or strengthen
**Platform:** Nice Academy (Khan Academy)

**9 completely NEW lessons needed:**

| Standard | Lesson | Placement |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| MS-ESS1-1 | Earth-Sun-Moon System | To be developed |
| MS-ESS1-3 | Scale of the Solar System | MS Earth and Space > Earth in space |

| MS-ETS1-3 | Analyzing and Combining Design Solutions | MS Science > Engineering and Design |
| MS-LS4-5 | Technology and Inheritance of Traits | To be developed |
| MS-PS4-3 | Digital vs. Analog Signals | To be developed |

**32 existing lessons need strengthening** — nearly every standard in Physical Science and many in Life Science and Earth/Space Science have only weak coverage through tangential videos/articles.

### Grade 8 — 45 lessons to add or strengthen
**Platform:** Nice Academy (Khan Academy)

**10 completely NEW lessons needed:**

| Standard | Lesson | Placement |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| MS-ESS1-1 | Earth-Sun-Moon System | To be developed |
| MS-ESS1-3 | Scale of the Solar System | MS Earth and Space > Earth in space |
| MS-ESS3-2 | Natural Hazard Forecasting | To be developed |
| MS-ESS3-3 | Monitoring Human Environmental Impact | To be developed |

| MS-ETS1-2 | Evaluating Competing Design Solutions | MS Science > Engineering and Design |
| MS-ETS1-3 | Analyzing and Combining Design Solutions | MS Science > Engineering and Design |
| MS-PS1-3 | Synthetic Materials from Natural Resources | MS Chemistry > Classifying matter |

**35 existing lessons need strengthening** — the Nice Academy curriculum has breadth but not NGSS-aligned depth. Most Physical Science, many Earth/Space Science, and several Life Science standards have only video/article coverage without the practice, investigation, and modeling components MAP expects.

## Part 3: Urgent Reteaching Needed (Students Scoring Below 50%)

These are standards where students have been tested and are failing. They need immediate intervention before MAP testing.

| Grade | Standard | Accuracy | What Students Are Struggling With |
|-------|----------|----------|----------------------------------|
| **G3** | 3-ESS2-1 | **44%** | Representing weather data in tables/graphical displays |
| **G5** | 3-5-ETS1-2 | **33%** | Comparing design solutions against criteria |
| **G7** | MS-LS2-5 | **0%** | Evaluating design solutions for biodiversity |
| **G7** | MS-PS3-1 | **33%** | Graphing kinetic energy vs. mass and speed |
| **G7** | MS-LS3-1 | **50%** | Modeling gene mutations and their effects on proteins |
| **G8** | MS-LS1-6 | **0%** | Explaining photosynthesis role in matter cycling |
| **G8** | MS-LS2-4 | **0%** | Arguing how ecosystem changes affect populations |
| **G8** | MS-PS4-3 | **25%** | Digital vs. analog signal reliability |
| **G8** | MS-PS2-2 | **33%** | Forces and changes in motion (Newton's Laws) |
| **G8** | MS-PS3-3 | **57%** | Designing devices for thermal energy transfer |

## Part 4: Test Quality Analysis — Beyond Coverage

In addition to the standards coverage gaps above, a cognitive complexity evaluation of all 83 tests (2,700+ questions) against the **Achieve Cognitive Complexity Framework** revealed a systemic quality issue:

### What MAP Expects vs. What Our Tests Assess

MAP Science items are designed around the Achieve framework's three-dimensional assessment model:

- **Scenario Complexity** — Questions grounded in real-world phenomena or data
- **Science & Engineering Practices (SEP)** — Students analyze, argue, model, or investigate
- **Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCI)** — Deep content knowledge applied to new situations
- **Crosscutting Concepts (CCC)** — Patterns, cause/effect, systems thinking

**The problem:** The majority of Alpha's current test questions operate at the "Scripted" or "Low Guided" complexity levels — basic recall and simple application. MAP items operate at "High Guided" or "Doing Science" levels requiring multi-step reasoning, evidence-based argumentation, and sense-making.

### What This Means

Even when we test the right standard, our questions may not prepare students for how MAP assesses that standard. Students who score well on our low-complexity questions may still struggle with MAP's higher-complexity items on the same content.

### Recommendation

For each grade level, the individual test dashboards (viewable at the interactive dashboard site) provide question-by-question complexity scores. Use these to:

1. Identify tests where the average complexity is "Scripted" or "Low Guided"
2. Rewrite or supplement those tests with higher-complexity questions that include scenarios, data interpretation, and evidence-based reasoning
3. Prioritize the standards where students already show low accuracy — these likely need both better instruction AND better assessment

---

## Prioritized Action Plan

### Immediate (Before MAP Testing)

1. **Reteach the 10 urgent standards** listed in Part 3 — these are active failures
2. **Write Engineering/Technology test questions** for all middle school grades — ETS1-1 through ETS1-4 are HIGH priority and completely missing from G4-G8 tests
3. **Brief review sessions** for the 27 additional standards where students score between 50-74%

### This Semester

4. **Add the 38 missing curriculum lessons** (entirely new content) across all grades
5. **Strengthen the 112 weakly-covered standards** by adding NGSS-aligned practice activities, investigations, and modeling tasks to existing lessons
6. **Write the remaining 104 missing test questions** (at least 1 per untested standard; ideally 3-5 per standard for reliable assessment)

### Ongoing

7. **Upgrade test question quality** — Using the per-test cognitive complexity dashboards, systematically revise questions to include real-world scenarios, data analysis, and evidence-based reasoning
8. **Re-evaluate quarterly** — As new tests and lessons are added, re-run this analysis to track progress toward full MAP alignment

## Bottom Line

Alpha School has solid science testing and curriculum coverage for Grades 3-5, with only minor gaps to fill. **The critical problem is in Grades 6-8**, where:

- **Two-thirds of MAP standards go untested** (66% of Grade 6, 47% of Grade 7, 49% of Grade 8)
- **Engineering/Technology is completely absent** from testing and mostly absent from curriculum in all middle school grades
- **Physical Science has the widest gap** — forces, energy, waves, and matter conservation standards are largely untested and weakly taught
- **Test question quality is too low** — even tested standards use recall-level questions while MAP expects three-dimensional sense-making

The specific fix lists in this document and the full Action Plan provide a standard-by-standard roadmap. The highest-impact action is addressing the Engineering/Technology gap (it's completely missing and MAP heavily weights it) followed by adding Physical Science content in Grades 6-8.
