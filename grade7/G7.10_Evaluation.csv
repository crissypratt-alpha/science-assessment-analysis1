Alpha Standardized Science G7.10,2,"Alpha Standardized Science G7.10 Created By STC 11 The following section focuses on an investigation of different substances that make icy sidewalks safer. Read the information below and use it to answer the three selected-response questions and one constructed- response question that follow. . . During winter, a class of students in Massachusetts completed an investigation to determine how to make icy sidewalks safer. They tested four substances to see whether the substances could melt ice. The information the students gathered about each substance is shown in Table 1. The students measured how long it took each substance to melt a different icy area on each of three days. All the icy areas the students tested were the same size. The data the students collected are shown in Table 2. Sand made the icy areas less slippery, but it did not melt the ice. Some of the substances harmed the grass. The following spring, the grass was brown and unhealthy next to the areas where sodium chloride and calcium chloride had been tested. However, the grass was green and healthy next to the areas where urea and sand had been tested. The chemical formula for urea is CH N O.

The following section focuses on how rust forms. Read the information below and use it to answer the three selected-response questions and one constructed- response question that follow. . . At the beginning of summer, some paint was scratched off a student’s bicycle. The exposed metal where the bicycle was scratched had a shiny, silvery color. The student kept the bicycle outside all summer. By the end of summer, the exposed metal had changed to rust, which is dark orange in color. The student did some research to find out what happened to the metal and learned that the bicycle is made of steel, which contains mostly iron. The student conducted two investigations to learn more about the process that changed the steel into rust. Investigation 1: The student placed equal amounts of iron filings (small pieces of iron) into beakers X, Y, and Z. At the start of the investigation, all of the filings were gray. The student added nothing else to beaker X, water to beaker Y, and table salt (NaCl) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to beaker Z. The student’s observations over a two-day period are shown in the table. Investigation 2: The student combined table salt and hydrogen peroxide in a beaker, added small pieces of steel, and placed a thermometer in the beaker. After one minute, the student measured the mass of the contents in the beaker. The student measured the contents in the beaker again at 10 minutes and discovered the mass had decreased slightly. The student’s observations are shown in the table. 12 When hydrogen peroxide reacts with iron, hydrogen peroxide first breaks apart to form water and oxygen. In the diagrams shown, hydrogen atoms are white and oxygen atoms are gray. Use the law of conservation of mass to determine the number of water and oxygen molecules produced in the reaction.

Alpha Standardized Science G7.10,43,"The rock strata of the Grand Canyon in Arizona contain evidence of approximately 32 percent of the geologic history of Earth and one billion years of fossil life on Earth. In the Grand Canyon, there are clear horizontal layers of different rocks that provide information about where, when, and how they were deposited, long before the canyon was even carved. The Law of Superposition states that sediment is deposited in layers in a sequence, the oldest rocks are on the bottom and the youngest rocks are on the top, similar to the way that sand piles up in an hour glass. This principle is a key part of determining the relative age of a rock layer. The three main rock layer sets in the Grand Canyon are grouped based on position and common composition and 1) Metamorphic basement rocks, 2) The Precambrian Grand Canyon Supergroup, and 3) Paleozoic strata. The three main types of rock are igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic. Igneous rocks are cooled magma (melted rock found underground) or lava (molten rock found above ground). Granite (cooled from magma, known as an intrusive igneous rock) and basalt (cooled from lava, known as an extrusive igneous rock) are two types of igneous rocks. Sedimentary rocks are formed by smaller pieces of sand and mud stuck together in layers. Over time, pressure increases as sediment increases, and minerals help form these rock layers. Metamorphic rocks are formed when sedimentary or igneous rocks change due to exposure to heat and/or pressure.
