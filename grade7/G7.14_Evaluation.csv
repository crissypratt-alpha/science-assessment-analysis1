Alpha Standardized Science G7.14,7,"Scientists have studied the relationship between cattle egrets and cattle in pastures across the world. Cattle egrets are white birds that follow cattle as they graze and move through grassy fields. When cattle walk through vegetation, they disturb insects hiding in the grass, causing them to move or fly away from their hiding places. The egrets then catch and eat these insects that would otherwise remain hidden. Research has shown that while egrets clearly benefit from this feeding opportunity, the cattle show no measurable changes in health, stress levels, or behavior whether the birds are present or absent. Scientists have conducted controlled studies comparing cattle with and without egrets present and found no significant differences in the cattle's weight gain, insect burden, or overall well-being.

Alpha Standardized Science G7.14,30,"John was making hot chocolate on a cold morning. He heated 200 grams of milk in a covered pot. He noticed that the inside of the pot's lid had many water droplets, and when he measured the milk after heating, it weighed 185 grams. What best explains why the milk weighed less after heating?",None,MC,"A) The heat caused the milk to become less dense, making it weigh less, B) Some of the milk proteins broke down during heating, decreasing the total mass, C) The hot milk molecules gained energy and became lighter than cold milk molecules, D) Some of the water in the milk evaporated and condensed on the pot's lid, reducing the mass of liquid milk",D,7,,2,Some context provided but limited scenario complexity.,3,Requires constructing explanations or engaging in argumentation.,2,Some content engagement in answer choices but limited reasoning with DCI.,1,"No CCC engagement.
