Convection Currents Reference: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/outreach/lesson_plans/Convection%20Currents.pdf Lava Lamp Station: Answer questions when at station. Plate Tectonics Station : Answer questions at sea-floor spreading station. Lava Lamp Convection currents also occur in lava lamps. We will use a lava lamp to represent what happens inside Earth. Earth's core causes temperatures to rise, which makes rock in mantle less dense. The density of the hot rock is less than the material above it, so it begins to rise. The rock hits the solid lithosphere and cannot rise any further. The rock begins to cool near the crust and becomes less dense. Gravity causes the more dense material to fall back down towards Earth's core. The cycle repeats. Scientists believe this constant motion causes the tectonic plates to move apart, crash together, or slide past each other. These movements result in new land features like mountains and trenches being created, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. Lava Lamp Station: Answer questions when at station.

Use the stimulus material and your knowledge of Science to answer the following questions. Dead Zone In the spring of each year, the second largest dead zone in the United States forms in the Gulf of Mexico. During the spring, farmers fertilize their land as they prepare for crop season. As a result, nutrients from the fertilizers, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, drain into the Mississippi River and eventually the Gulf of Mexico. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, “Excess nutrients that run off land or are piped as wastewater into rivers and coasts can stimulate an overgrowth of algae, which then sinks and decomposes in the water” (NOAA, 2018).
