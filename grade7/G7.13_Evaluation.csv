Alpha Standardized Science G7.13,1,"Alpha Standardized Science G7.13 Created By STC 11 Earth’s outer shell is divided into large pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are constantly moving, though very slowly. Sometimes they move toward one another, sometimes they pull apart, and sometimes they slide past each other. Over long periods of time, these movements change the shape of Earth’s surface. Different types of plate interactions produce different landforms. These processes, like subduction, collision, rifting, and others, help explain why certain features like mountains, valleys, ridges, or volcanoes appear in some regions and not in others. Scientists continue to study these plate movements to better understand how Earth’s surface evolves over time.
