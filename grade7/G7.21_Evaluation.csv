Alpha Standardized Science G7.21,35,Cactus plants have developed sharp spines instead of leaves to minimize water loss in hot environments. These spines also protect the cacti from predators trying to feed on them. Suppose a bird with a long beak is able to feed on cacti with shorter spines. How will the population of cacti change if this behavior continues?,None,MC,"A) The short-spined cacti population will become larger than the long spined cacti., B) The long-spined cacti population will become larger than the short spined cacti., C) The cacti population will remain constant in future generations, regardless of spine length., D) The cacti population will increase in number to compensate for the losses.
