Sometimes they result from the lowering of groundwater levels in aquifers. Groundwater provides extra support to help stabilize these rocks. When water levels in an aquifer decrease, the rocks originally holding the water can become weak, and sinkholes can result. The San Joaquin Valley in California, known for its fruit and nut orchards and large vegetable farms, uses water from local aquifers for irrigation. The highest demand for groundwater in this region is generally during the spring and summer, which are not only peak growing seasons but also the driest seasons of the year. In May 2016, a large sinkhole opened up in a lane of Interstate 5 in the San Joaquin Valley.
