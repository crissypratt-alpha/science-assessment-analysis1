Use the information about changes in Earth's magnetic field and your knowledge of science to answer the questions. Changes in Earth's Magnetic Field Earth has a magnetic field that extends from the North and South Poles of the planet and out into space. Many scientists suggest that Earth's magnetic field size, strength, and direction are related to the liquid iron outer core. Figure 1 shows a model of Earth's core. Scientists discovered that the locations of Earth's North and South Poles can switch every so often. About every few hundred thousand years, Earth's magnetic poles reverse. This is a result of Earth's magnetic field changing direction, as shown by the dotted magnetic field lines in Figure 2. Evidence of the reversal of Earth's magnetic field is found in the rocks along the ocean floor. The ocean floor moves away slowly from the ridge on either side. As lava from the ridge erupts, tiny fragments in the lava align with the direction of Earth's magnetic field before the lava cools to become solid rock. Some of these fragments have a normal magnetic direction, while other fragments have a reverse magnetic direction.

The Skin as a Protector The skin is the human body’s largest organ. At 1.8 square meters for the average adult, skin covers about as much area as a large closet, and accounts for 12-15% of total body weight. The incredible variation in skin — oily, moist, or dry, exposed to light and cold, or dark and warm — even on an individual, creates unique habitats for the thousands of bacterial and fungal species (called commensal microbiota) that live on our skin. The skin immune system may control skin microbes, but our skin commensals can also educate our immune system. How our skin orchestrates this dialogue with microorganisms and physical insult is integral to its function, and to our health. The skin is an immunologic organ. There are an estimated 20 billion T cells in human skin — far greater than the number of T cells in the blood — suggesting that immune defense in the skin is a high priority. The interaction among skin microorganisms and the immune system is likely not adversarial most of the time.

Answer the following questions after reading this passage. The Spinach and Carrot Plant Experiment Plants utilize light energy to make food by the process of photosynthesis. The food made by the plant is used to perform life functions and to grow. A student performed an experiment to study the growth of carrot and spinach plants under different colored lights. Table 1 lists the procedure followed. Table 1 1. Take a potted spinach and a carrot plant, each of a height of 5 cm. 2. Place both the pots together under a red bulb. 3. Keep the bulb lighted for 8 hours daily. 4. Provide 50 ml. of water to both the pots daily in the morning and in the evening. 5. Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 with green, orange, blue, and violet bulbs. 6. Study the growth of plants for a duration of 30 days. Table 2 shows the height of each plant recorded on the 30th day.
