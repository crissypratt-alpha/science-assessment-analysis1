It actively hunts for small fish and scavenges dead animals on the ocean floor. The crab grows by shedding its old shell and forming a new, larger one., B) The sea squirt looks like a colorful tube attached to the seafloor. It filters tiny food particles from the water by drawing water in through one opening and pushing it out another. Unlike plants, it cannot make its own nutrients and must consume food to survive., C) The sea star has five arms extending from a central body. It moves slowly using hundreds of tiny tube feet and feeds by pushing its stomach out of its body to digest clams and oysters. It can regrow arms that are damaged or lost to predators., D) The green seaweed attaches to rocks in shallow water where sunlight can reach it.
