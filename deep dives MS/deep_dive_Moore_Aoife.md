## SECTION 2 — Course Progress & Effort

### Table 2.1 — Course Progress

| % Complete | Total XP Earned | Total XP Remaining | Time in Course (days) | Avg XP / School Day |
|------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| 42% | MISSING | 1134 (total MS Science) | 27 | MISSING |

**Notes**
- **% Complete**: 42% of MS Chemistry (current course). XP remaining in current course = 199 XP.
- **Total XP Remaining**: 1,134 XP to complete all middle school science (199 XP Chemistry + 340 XP Physics + 240 XP Earth & Space Science + 355 XP Supplementary Course).
- **Time in Course (days)**: 27 unique school days with recorded test activity across all subjects (Aug 28 through Jan 23, 2026). Science-specific test days: 7 (Sep 17 placement, Sep 19, Nov 5, Nov 21, Dec 4, Dec 9, Dec 11, Jan 5).
- **Avg XP / School Day**: Explicit daily XP not provided. Daily XP target if science every other week = 33.4 XP; if daily = 16.7 XP.

## SECTION 3 — Assessment & Practice Signals

### Table 3.1 — Assessment & Practice

| Test Attempts | Last Test Date | Hole-Filling Attempts | Accuracy Trend | Fluency Signal |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 35 | 2026-01-23 | 19 | Improving | Not assessed |

**Notes**
- **Test Attempts**: 35 total test submissions across all subjects. Subject breakdown: Writing (6), Math (5), Science (7), Language (5), Reading (4), Vocabulary (8). Science = 7 of 35 (20%).
- **Science testing**:
  - Alpha Standardized Science G5.1 — 94% on Dec 9, 2025
  - Alpha Standardized Science G6.9 — 95% on Dec 11, 2025
  - Alpha Standardized Science G7.13 — 68% on Jan 5, 2026
- **Last Test Date**: 2026-01-23 (Writing). Last Science-specific test: 2026-01-05.
- **Hole-Filling Attempts**: 19 of 35 tests (54%) were non-effective (Effective Test? = 0), indicating significant remediation across Language, Reading, Writing, Math, Vocabulary, and Science.
- **Accuracy Trend**: Improving in Science. Moved from G5.1 (94%) → G6.9 (95%) → G7.13 (68%). The drop at G7.13 reflects hitting grade-level content, not regression. Cross-subject accuracy has also trended upward from early-year placement scores (34–55% range on Sep 17) to recent 80–98% on effective tests.
- **Fluency Signal**: Not assessed. No fluency-specific data in any source file.

## SECTION 4 — Learning Velocity & Growth

### Table 4.1 — Growth Metrics

| Growth X | Expected Growth X | Meets 2× Target? | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| 3.3 (winter-to-winter) | 2.0 | Yes | Winter 2024-25 RIT 219 → Winter 2025-26 RIT 229 = 10-point gain vs. 3-point projected growth (3.3×). Fall-to-Winter Growth X = 8 (Fall RIT 221 → Winter RIT 229 = 8-point gain vs. 1-point projected). Strong recent MAP growth despite platform HMG remaining at grade 6. Effective Grades Mastered = 2 this year (Section 1). |

---

## SECTION 5 — MAP Growth Context

### Table 5.1 — MAP Profile

| MAP Math RIT | MAP Grade Band | Domains Missed | Alignment Risk |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| MISSING | MISSING | MISSING | Medium |

**Notes**
- **MAP Math RIT**: Aoife Moore was not found in the MAP Scores file (MAP_ScoresEmail). Science RIT from Predictions file: Fall 221 → Winter 229 (8-point gain). Predicted RIT was 238; actual Winter is 229, underperforming the prediction by 9 points.
- **MAP Grade Band**: Cannot be determined without the MAP normative lookup. Winter Science RIT 229 for an 8th grader is approximately at-grade or slightly below national median.
- **Domains Missed**: No MAP domain/strand-level data available. MISSING.
- **Alignment Risk**: **Medium**. MAP growth is strong (8×), showing real learning. However, the G7.13 Science test score of 68% (Section 3) suggests Aoife is just at the threshold of grade 7 content mastery. The platform HMG of 6 is broadly consistent with the MAP data showing at-grade-level performance, but the high remediation volume (54% hole-filling) suggests time is being spread too thin across subjects.

## SECTION 6 — Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Root Cause

**Accuracy constraint**

### Secondary Root Cause

Insufficient time on task

### Evidence

- Aoife's Science accuracy drops sharply at grade 7 content: G5.1 = 94%, G6.9 = 95%, but **G7.13 = 68%** (Section 3). The 68% score indicates she is hitting an accuracy wall at the transition from grade 6 to grade 7 Science, which is what prevents forward mastery progression.
- **HMG = 6 with Effective Grades Mastered = 2** this year (Section 1), confirming progress through lower-grade content but inability to break through at grade 7.
- **54% of all tests are hole-filling** (Section 3), indicating the platform repeatedly cycles Aoife through remediation rather than advancing her, consistent with an accuracy constraint at the current grade boundary.
- Science receives only 20% of total test attempts (7 of 35) — Section 3. Even with improving accuracy, the low volume of Science testing limits the rate at which mastery can be demonstrated.
- **Winter RIT = 229 vs. Predicted 238** (Section 5): Aoife underperformed the predicted RIT by 9 points, suggesting the accuracy constraint is real and not a platform artifact — knowledge at the grade 7 level is genuinely developing but not yet solid.
- **Daily XP target = 33.4 XP** if science remains every other week (Section 2). This is a very high bar and means any time lost to accuracy-driven reteaching compounds the pacing challenge.

## SECTION 7 — Completion Projection

### Fixed Assumptions
- XP per day = **25**
- Days per week = **5**

### Table 7.1 — Projection

| XP Remaining | XP / Day Assumed | Days / Week | Weeks to Finish | Finish Before EOY? |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 1134 | 25 | 5 | 10 | No |

**Calculation**
- Weeks to Finish = 1134 ÷ (25 × 5) = 1134 ÷ 125 = 9.07 → rounded **up** = **10 weeks**.
- 10 weeks from early February 2026 lands in approximately mid-April 2026. However, this assumes 25 XP/day of sustained daily Science engagement. Given Aoife's accuracy constraint at G7 content (68%) and the current every-other-week cadence requiring 33.4 XP/day, finishing all MS Science by EOY is **unlikely** without both increased frequency and accuracy improvement. Rated **No**.

## SECTION 8 — Intervention Levers

### Actions (maximum 5 bullets)

1. **Implement targeted Science G7 reteaching sessions before the next G7 test attempt (within 2 weeks).** Aoife scored 68% on G7.13 — just below passing. Focused instruction on the specific domains tested at G7.13 could push accuracy above the mastery threshold on the next attempt.

2. **Increase Science frequency to daily (this week).** At the every-other-week cadence, the 33.4 XP/day target is unrealistic. Moving to daily Science reduces the required pace to 16.7 XP/day, which is closer to feasible given Aoife's demonstrated effort across subjects.

3. **Reduce cross-subject hole-filling during Science blocks (next 3 weeks).** 54% of all tests are hole-filling across non-Science subjects. Protecting Science time from competing remediation demands is critical to maintaining forward progress.

4. **Set a 3-week Science accuracy checkpoint by March 3: re-attempt G7 content with ≥75% target.** If Aoife clears the G7 accuracy threshold within 3 weeks, she can begin accumulating grade 7 mastery and accelerate through the rest of Chemistry. If not, revisit whether additional scaffolding (videos, manipulatives) is needed.

5. **Monitor MAP-to-platform alignment at the next MAP testing window.** Winter RIT underperformed prediction by 9 points (Section 5). If the next MAP score does not improve, consider whether the curriculum pathway is providing adequate exposure to MAP-tested domains.
