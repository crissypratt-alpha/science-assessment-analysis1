## SECTION 1 — Student Snapshot

### Table 1.1 — Student Snapshot

| Student | Campus | Enrollment Grade | Current Course | Age Grade | Course Grade | Highest Mastered Grade (HMG) |
|--------|--------|------------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Roarke Radia | Alpha School Austin | 8 | Nice Academy - Middle school Earth and space science | 8 | 6 - 8 | 5 |

**Definitions**
- **Enrollment Grade**: grade level assigned by enrollment — 8.
- **Age Grade**: chronological grade level — 8.
- **Course Grade**: nominal grade level of the current course — 6 - 8 (multi-grade span).
- **HMG**: highest fully mastered grade level (not "working in") — 5. Highest Mastered Grade 25-26 = 5, Effective Grades Mastered This Year = 1. Knowledge Grade = 6, Effective Grade = 5. Roarke is 3 grade levels below age grade in Science mastery.

## SECTION 2 — Course Progress & Effort

### Table 2.1 — Course Progress

| % Complete | Total XP Earned | Total XP Remaining | Time in Course (days) | Avg XP / School Day |
|------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| 62% | MISSING | 447 (total MS Science) | 19 | MISSING |

**Notes**
- **% Complete**: 62% of MS Earth and Space Science (current course). XP remaining in current course = 92 XP.
- **Total XP Remaining**: 447 XP to complete all middle school science (92 XP Earth & Space Science + 355 XP Supplementary Course). Roarke has already completed Chemistry and Physics.
- **Time in Course (days)**: 19 unique school days with recorded test activity across all subjects (Aug 26 through Jan 27, 2026). Science-specific test days: 2 (Aug 26, Nov 5).
- **Avg XP / School Day**: Explicit daily XP not provided. Daily XP target if science every other week = 13.2 XP; if daily = 6.6 XP. Both targets are relatively low — this is the most achievable projection of all six students.

## SECTION 3 — Assessment & Practice Signals

### Table 3.1 — Assessment & Practice

| Test Attempts | Last Test Date | Hole-Filling Attempts | Accuracy Trend | Fluency Signal |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 29 | 2026-01-27 | 16 | Flat | Not assessed |

**Notes**
- **Test Attempts**: 29 total test submissions across all subjects. Subject breakdown: Writing (11), Vocabulary (6), Reading (5), Language (3), Math (2), Science (2). Science = 2 of 29 (7%).
- **Science testing**:
  - Alpha Standardized Science G5.13 — 96% on Aug 26, 2025
  - Alpha Standardized Science G6.13 — 69% on Nov 5, 2025
- **Last Test Date**: 2026-01-27 (Vocabulary). Last Science-specific test: 2025-11-05 — over 3 months ago.
- **Hole-Filling Attempts**: 16 of 29 tests (55%) were non-effective (Effective Test? = 0). Heavy hole-filling in Writing (8 of 11), Reading (4 of 5), and Vocabulary (2 of 6).
- **Accuracy Trend**: Flat overall. Science shows a sharp drop from G5 (96%) to G6 (69%), indicating an accuracy wall at grade 6 content. Cross-subject accuracy is generally in the 80–95% range on non-effective tests but inconsistent on effective tests.
- **Fluency Signal**: Not assessed. No fluency-specific data in any source file.

## SECTION 4 — Learning Velocity & Growth

### Table 4.1 — Growth Metrics

| Growth X | Expected Growth X | Meets 2× Target? | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| 5.5 (winter-to-winter) | 2.0 | Yes | Winter 2024-25 RIT 221 → Winter 2025-26 RIT 232 = 11-point gain vs. 2-point projected growth (5.5×). Fall-to-Winter Growth X = 5 (Fall RIT 227 → Winter RIT 232 = 5-point gain vs. 1-point projected). Strong MAP growth despite platform HMG remaining at grade 5. Effective Grades Mastered = 1 this year (Section 1). |

---

## SECTION 5 — MAP Growth Context

### Table 5.1 — MAP Profile

| MAP Math RIT | MAP Grade Band | Domains Missed | Alignment Risk |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| MISSING | MISSING | MISSING | High |

**Notes**
- **MAP Math RIT**: Roarke Radia was not found in the MAP Scores file (MAP_ScoresEmail). Science RIT from Predictions file: Fall 227 → Winter 232 (5-point gain). Predicted RIT was 236; actual Winter is 232, underperforming by 4 points.
- **MAP Grade Band**: Cannot be determined without the MAP normative lookup. Winter Science RIT 232 for an 8th grader is approximately at the national median.
- **Domains Missed**: No MAP domain/strand-level data available. MISSING.
- **Alignment Risk**: **High**. MAP growth is very strong (5× fall-to-winter), showing real Science learning is occurring. However, platform HMG = 5 and only 2 Science tests have been taken all year (Section 3). The 3-month testing gap since Nov 5 means the platform has no recent Science data to advance mastery. The disconnect between MAP growth and platform mastery is driven primarily by lack of Science testing, not lack of knowledge.

## SECTION 6 — Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Root Cause

**Insufficient time on task**

### Secondary Root Cause

Accuracy constraint

### Evidence

- Roarke has taken only **2 Science tests** out of 29 total test attempts (Section 3) — just 7% of testing effort directed at Science. The last Science test was **Nov 5, 2025**, leaving a 3+ month gap with zero Science testing.
- **55% of all tests are hole-filling** (Section 3), with the bulk in Writing (8 of 11 Writing tests are non-effective). Science time is being crowded out by remediation in other subjects.
- The **G6.13 Science test = 69%** (Section 3), which also suggests a secondary accuracy constraint at grade 6 content. However, with only 2 Science tests all year, there has been virtually no opportunity to improve or re-attempt.
- **MAP Growth X = 5.5 winter-to-winter and 5× fall-to-winter** (Section 4), confirming Science knowledge is growing on MAP even while platform mastery stagnates. This means the primary barrier is engagement volume, not ability.
- With only **447 XP remaining** (Section 2) and targets of 13.2 XP/day (every other week) or 6.6 XP/day (daily), this is the most achievable completion scenario among all six students — but only if Science testing actually resumes.

---

## SECTION 7 — Completion Projection

### Fixed Assumptions
- XP per day = **25**
- Days per week = **5**

### Table 7.1 — Projection

| XP Remaining | XP / Day Assumed | Days / Week | Weeks to Finish | Finish Before EOY? |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 447 | 25 | 5 | 4 | Yes |

**Calculation**
- Weeks to Finish = 447 ÷ (25 × 5) = 447 ÷ 125 = 3.58 → rounded **up** = **4 weeks**.
- 4 weeks from early February 2026 lands in early March 2026 — well before EOY. Even at the every-other-week target of 13.2 XP/day, this is feasible if Science testing resumes immediately. Rated **Yes**.

## SECTION 8 — Intervention Levers

### Actions (maximum 5 bullets)

1. **Resume Science testing immediately (this week).** Roarke has not taken a Science test since Nov 5, 2025 — a 3+ month gap. With only 447 XP remaining, even modest re-engagement will produce rapid progress. Schedule at least 2 Science tests per week starting this week.

2. **Re-attempt G6.13 Science content within 5 school days.** The 69% score on G6.13 is just below passing. A brief review of the tested domains followed by a re-attempt could unlock grade 6 mastery and open grade 7 content.

3. **Protect Science instructional time from Writing hole-filling (next 4 weeks).** 8 of 11 Writing tests are non-effective remediation (Section 3). Temporarily limit Writing hole-filling during Science blocks to ensure Science receives dedicated instructional minutes.

4. **Set a 4-week completion target: finish Earth & Space Science (92 XP) by March 7 and begin Supplementary Course.** Given only 447 XP total remaining, this student has the clearest path to MS Science completion among the cohort. Hold Roarke accountable to this achievable milestone.

5. **Conference with student within 5 school days to understand the Science testing gap.** Determine why no Science tests were attempted for 3+ months despite strong MAP growth. Address any motivational or scheduling barriers to re-engagement.
