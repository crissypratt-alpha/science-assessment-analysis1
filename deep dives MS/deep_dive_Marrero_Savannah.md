## SECTION 1 — Student Snapshot

### Table 1.1 — Student Snapshot

| Student | Campus | Enrollment Grade | Current Course | Age Grade | Course Grade | Highest Mastered Grade (HMG) |
|--------|--------|------------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Savannah Marrero | Alpha School Brownsville | 8 | Nice Academy - Middle school physics | 8 | 6 - 8 | 6 |

**Definitions**
- **Enrollment Grade**: grade level assigned by enrollment — 8.
- **Age Grade**: chronological grade level — 8.
- **Course Grade**: nominal grade level of the current course — 6 - 8 (multi-grade span).
- **HMG**: highest fully mastered grade level (not "working in") — 6. Highest Mastered Grade 25-26 is empty (no new grade fully mastered this year). Effective Grades Mastered This Year = 0. Knowledge Grade = 7, Effective Grade = 5, R90 = 4. Savannah has completed Chemistry and is now in Physics but has not yet broken through to grade 7 mastery.

## SECTION 3 — Assessment & Practice Signals

### Table 3.1 — Assessment & Practice

| Test Attempts | Last Test Date | Hole-Filling Attempts | Accuracy Trend | Fluency Signal |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 31 | 2026-02-05 | 12 | Flat | Not assessed |

**Notes**
- **Test Attempts**: 31 total test submissions across all subjects. Subject breakdown: Vocabulary (11), Language (6), Writing (6), Reading (4), Science (2), Math (1), Writing additional (1). Science = 2 of 31 (6%).
- **Science testing**:
  - Alpha Standardized Science G7 — 80% on Oct 27, 2025
  - Alpha Standardized Science G7 — 70% on Jan 8, 2026
- **Last Test Date**: 2026-02-05 (Math). Last Science-specific test: 2026-01-08 — over 1 month ago.
- **Hole-Filling Attempts**: 12 of 31 tests (39%) were non-effective (Effective Test? = 0). Concentrated in Vocabulary (5 of 11), Writing (5 of 6), and Language (1 of 6). Science hole-filling = 0 (both Science tests were effective).
- **Accuracy Trend**: Flat to declining in Science. G7 accuracy dropped from 80% (Oct 27) to 70% (Jan 8) — a 10-point decline on the same grade-level content. Cross-subject accuracy is generally strong: Vocabulary effective tests range 85–100%, Language effective tests 67–100%, Reading effective tests 65–92%.
- **Fluency Signal**: Not assessed. No fluency-specific data in any source file.

## SECTION 4 — Learning Velocity & Growth

### Table 4.1 — Growth Metrics

| Growth X | Expected Growth X | Meets 2× Target? | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| 1.0 (winter-to-winter) | 2.0 | No | Winter 2024-25 RIT 233 → Winter 2025-26 RIT 235 = 2-point gain vs. 2-point projected growth (1.0×). Fall-to-Winter Growth X = 6 (Fall RIT 229 → Winter RIT 235 = 6-point gain vs. 1-point projected). Strong recent growth from Fall to Winter, but annualized winter-to-winter growth is only at the expected rate — not meeting the 2× target. Effective Grades Mastered = 0 this year (Section 1). |

## SECTION 5 — MAP Growth Context

### Table 5.1 — MAP Profile

| MAP Math RIT | MAP Grade Band | Domains Missed | Alignment Risk |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| MISSING | MISSING | MISSING | Medium |

**Notes**
- **MAP Math RIT**: Savannah Marrero was not found in the MAP Scores file (MAP_ScoresEmail). Science RIT from Predictions file: Fall 229 → Winter 235 (6-point gain). Predicted RIT was 239; actual Winter is 235, underperforming by 4 points.
- **MAP Grade Band**: Cannot be determined without MAP normative lookup. Winter Science RIT 235 for an 8th grader is approximately at or slightly above the national median.
- **Domains Missed**: No MAP domain/strand-level data available. MISSING.
- **Alignment Risk**: **Medium**. MAP fall-to-winter growth is strong (6×), but winter-to-winter growth is only 1× — suggesting gains are recent and may not yet be durable. The G7 Science accuracy decline from 80% to 70% (Section 3) is concerning because it diverges from the MAP growth trend, indicating possible content-specific gaps in the grade 7 Physics curriculum that MAP does not directly test. Platform HMG = 6 with 0 effective grades mastered this year aligns with the stalled accuracy.

## SECTION 6 — Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Root Cause

**Insufficient time on task**

### Secondary Root Cause

Accuracy constraint

### Evidence

- Savannah has taken only **2 Science tests** out of 31 total test attempts (Section 3) — just 6% of testing effort directed at Science. This is the lowest Science testing rate of any student analyzed in this cohort. The enrolled course (MS Physics) has received negligible testing attention.
- **Science accuracy declined from 80% to 70%** on G7 content between Oct 27 and Jan 8 (Section 3). With only 2 Science tests in 5 months, there has been no opportunity for the platform to diagnose specific weaknesses or for Savannah to practice and improve. The accuracy decline with so few attempts suggests a secondary knowledge gap at grade 7 rather than just insufficient volume.
- **Effective Grades Mastered This Year = 0** (Section 1). Despite being enrolled in Physics (which implies Chemistry was already completed), Savannah has made zero forward mastery progress this school year.
- **Winter-to-winter Growth X = 1.0** (Section 4), the only student in this analysis who does **not** meet the 2× growth target on an annualized basis. While fall-to-winter growth is strong (6×), the annualized trajectory is stagnant.
- **39% of all tests are hole-filling** (Section 3), with Writing consuming 5 of 6 test attempts as non-effective and Vocabulary consuming 5 of 11 as non-effective. Science time is being displaced by remediation in these subjects.
- **Predicted RIT = 239, actual = 235** (Section 5): A 4-point underperformance suggesting Savannah's Science knowledge is developing but not yet meeting expectations, consistent with both the time-on-task and accuracy constraints.

## SECTION 7 — Completion Projection

### Fixed Assumptions
- XP per day = **25**
- Days per week = **5**

### Table 7.1 — Projection

| XP Remaining | XP / Day Assumed | Days / Week | Weeks to Finish | Finish Before EOY? |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| MISSING | 25 | 5 | MISSING | MISSING |

**Notes**
- XP data was not provided for Savannah Marrero. Without Total XP Remaining, the projection formula (XP Remaining ÷ 125, rounded up) cannot be computed.
- **Qualitative estimate**: Savannah is enrolled in MS Physics (the second course in the sequence, meaning Chemistry is already done). However, with only 2 Science tests in 5 months, a declining accuracy trend (80% → 70% on G7), and 0 effective grades mastered this year, her current trajectory is extremely slow. Without a dramatic increase in Science testing frequency and targeted G7 reteaching, finishing remaining MS Science courses by EOY is unlikely.

## SECTION 8 — Intervention Levers

### Actions (maximum 5 bullets)

1. **Resume Science testing immediately and sustain a minimum of 2 Science tests per week (this week).** Savannah has taken only 2 Science tests in 5 months — the lowest rate in the analysis cohort. No progress is possible without re-engagement. Given she is in Physics (Chemistry already complete), she is further along the course sequence than most peers; momentum exists to build on.

2. **Provide targeted G7 Science reteaching before the next test attempt (within 5 school days).** Accuracy declined from 80% to 70% on G7 content (Section 3), suggesting specific conceptual gaps — not just lack of practice. Identify the specific G7 domains tested and provide focused instruction before the next attempt.

3. **Reduce Writing hole-filling during Science blocks (next 4 weeks).** 5 of 6 Writing tests are non-effective remediation (Section 3). Temporarily limit Writing hole-filling during designated Science time to protect Science instructional minutes. Savannah's Writing accuracy on non-effective tests is already high (83–96%), suggesting diminishing returns from continued Writing remediation.

4. **Set a 4-week checkpoint by March 14: pass a G7 Science test at ≥75% and demonstrate forward progress.** This creates an accountability milestone. If Savannah can break through the G7 accuracy barrier (which she was at 80% in October), she can resume mastery progression. If she cannot, escalate to a diagnostic review.

5. **Conference with student within 5 school days to investigate the Science disengagement.** Savannah's winter-to-winter Growth X of 1.0 is the weakest in the cohort (Section 4). Determine whether motivational, scheduling, or content-specific barriers are driving the near-total absence of Science testing, and establish a concrete plan for re-engagement.
