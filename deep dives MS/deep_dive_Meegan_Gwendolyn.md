## SECTION 1 — Student Snapshot

### Table 1.1 — Student Snapshot

| Student | Campus | Enrollment Grade | Current Course | Age Grade | Course Grade | Highest Mastered Grade (HMG) |
|--------|--------|------------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Gwendolyn Meegan | Alpha School Austin | 8 | Nice Academy - Middle school chemistry | 8 | 6 - 8 | 6 |

**Definitions**
- **Enrollment Grade**: grade level assigned by enrollment — 8.
- **Age Grade**: chronological grade level — 8.
- **Course Grade**: nominal grade level of the current course — 6 - 8 (multi-grade span).
- **HMG**: highest fully mastered grade level (not "working in") — 6. Effective Grades Mastered This Year = 2. Knowledge Grade = 7, Effective Grade = 5, R90 = 4. Gwendolyn is working in grade 7 content but has not yet mastered it.

## SECTION 2 — Course Progress & Effort

### Table 2.1 — Course Progress

| % Complete | Total XP Earned | Total XP Remaining | Time in Course (days) | Avg XP / School Day |
|------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| 55% | MISSING | 1089 (total MS Science) | 28 | MISSING |

**Notes**
- **% Complete**: 55% of MS Chemistry (current course). XP remaining in current course = 154 XP.
- **Total XP Remaining**: 1,089 XP to complete all middle school science (154 XP Chemistry + 340 XP Physics + 240 XP Earth & Space Science + 355 XP Supplementary Course).
- **Time in Course (days)**: 28 unique school days with recorded test activity across all subjects (Sep 2 through Jan 26, 2026). Science-specific test days: 6 (Sep 17 placement, Oct 30, Nov 11, Jan 4, Jan 9).
- **Avg XP / School Day**: Explicit daily XP not provided. Daily XP target if science every other week = 32 XP; if daily = 16 XP.

## SECTION 3 — Assessment & Practice Signals

### Table 3.1 — Assessment & Practice

| Test Attempts | Last Test Date | Hole-Filling Attempts | Accuracy Trend | Fluency Signal |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 39 | 2026-01-26 | 23 | Improving | Not assessed |

**Notes**
- **Test Attempts**: 39 total test submissions across all subjects. Subject breakdown: Reading (11), Writing (9), Vocabulary (6), Language (5), Science (6), Math (2). Science = 6 of 39 (15%).
- **Science testing**:
  - Alpha Standardized Science G6.11 — 88% on Oct 30, 2025
  - Alpha Standardized Science G6.13 — 78% on Nov 11, 2025
  - Alpha Standardized Science G6.1 — 98% on Jan 4, 2026
  - Alpha Standardized Science G7.13 — 75% on Jan 9, 2026
- **Last Test Date**: 2026-01-26 (Writing). Last Science-specific test: 2026-01-09.
- **Hole-Filling Attempts**: 23 of 39 tests (59%) were non-effective (Effective Test? = 0). Heavy hole-filling across Reading (8 of 11), Writing (7 of 9), Language (3 of 5), Vocabulary (3 of 6).
- **Accuracy Trend**: Improving in Science. Grade 6 content scores improved from 78% → 88% → 98%, and the first G7 attempt scored 75% — just at the mastery threshold. Cross-subject accuracy also trends upward from Sep 17 placement scores (45–57% in Math, 50% in Language) to recent 80–98% range.
- **Fluency Signal**: Not assessed. No fluency-specific data in any source file.

## SECTION 4 — Learning Velocity & Growth

### Table 4.1 — Growth Metrics

| Growth X | Expected Growth X | Meets 2× Target? | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| 3.0 (winter-to-winter) | 2.0 | Yes | Winter 2024-25 RIT 228 → Winter 2025-26 RIT 234 = 6-point gain vs. 2-point projected growth (3.0×). Fall-to-Winter Growth X = 3 (Fall RIT 231 → Winter RIT 234 = 3-point gain vs. 1-point projected). Consistent, moderate MAP growth. Predicted RIT was 239; actual Winter is 234, underperforming by 5 points. Effective Grades Mastered = 2 this year (Section 1). |

---

## SECTION 5 — MAP Growth Context

### Table 5.1 — MAP Profile

| MAP Math RIT | MAP Grade Band | Domains Missed | Alignment Risk |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| MISSING | MISSING | MISSING | Medium |

**Notes**
- **MAP Math RIT**: Gwendolyn Meegan was not found in the MAP Scores file (MAP_ScoresEmail). Science RIT from Predictions file: Fall 231 → Winter 234 (3-point gain). Predicted RIT was 239; actual Winter is 234, underperforming by 5 points.
- **MAP Grade Band**: Cannot be determined without MAP normative lookup. Winter Science RIT 234 for an 8th grader is approximately at or slightly above the national median.
- **Domains Missed**: No MAP domain/strand-level data available. MISSING.
- **Alignment Risk**: **Medium**. MAP growth is solid (3×) and Gwendolyn's Science accuracy trend is improving (Section 3). The G7.13 score of 75% suggests she is right at the threshold of grade 7 mastery. Platform HMG = 6 is broadly consistent with a student just beginning to master grade 7 content. The main risk is pacing — with 1,089 XP remaining and 59% hole-filling, time allocation is the constraining factor more than knowledge gaps.

## SECTION 6 — Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Root Cause

**Insufficient time on task**

### Secondary Root Cause

Accuracy constraint

### Evidence

- Science receives only **15% of total test attempts** (6 of 39) — Section 3. Despite improving Science accuracy, the low volume of Science testing limits the rate at which mastery can accumulate.
- **59% of all tests are hole-filling** (Section 3), the highest hole-filling rate among the cohort. Reading (8 of 11) and Writing (7 of 9) dominate remediation effort, crowding out Science engagement.
- **G7.13 Science = 75%** (Section 3), which is right at the mastery threshold. A secondary accuracy constraint exists at grade 7 — Gwendolyn is close but not yet consistently above 75% at grade 7 level. However, her G6 accuracy trajectory (78% → 88% → 98%) demonstrates she can improve with exposure.
- **Daily XP target = 32 XP** at current every-other-week cadence (Section 2), which is extremely high. Even at daily frequency (16 XP/day target), the 1,089 XP remaining requires sustained effort.
- **Winter RIT = 234 vs. Predicted 239** (Section 5), a 5-point underperformance suggesting knowledge is building but not yet matching projections — consistent with a student who is learning but not getting enough Science practice reps.

## SECTION 7 — Completion Projection

### Fixed Assumptions
- XP per day = **25**
- Days per week = **5**

### Table 7.1 — Projection

| XP Remaining | XP / Day Assumed | Days / Week | Weeks to Finish | Finish Before EOY? |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 1089 | 25 | 5 | 9 | Borderline |

**Calculation**
- Weeks to Finish = 1089 ÷ (25 × 5) = 1089 ÷ 125 = 8.71 → rounded **up** = **9 weeks**.
- 9 weeks from early February 2026 lands in approximately mid-April 2026. Technically before EOY, but assumes daily Science engagement at 25 XP/day — a pace Gwendolyn has not yet demonstrated given only 6 Science tests in 5 months. Rated **Borderline**.

---

## SECTION 8 — Intervention Levers

### Actions (maximum 5 bullets)

1. **Increase Science frequency to daily immediately (this week).** At the every-other-week cadence, the 32 XP/day target is unrealistic. Daily Science reduces the required pace to 16 XP/day, which aligns with Gwendolyn's demonstrated improvement trajectory.

2. **Capitalize on the G7.13 momentum — reattempt G7 content within 1 week.** Gwendolyn scored 75% on G7.13, right at threshold. A focused review session followed by a reattempt within the next 5 school days could break through the grade 7 mastery barrier while the material is fresh.

3. **Reduce Reading and Writing hole-filling during Science blocks (next 4 weeks).** 15 of 20 Reading + Writing tests are hole-filling (Section 3). Temporarily redirect this time to Science to protect forward progress on the enrolled course.

4. **Set a 4-week checkpoint by March 7: complete MS Chemistry (154 XP remaining) and begin Physics.** Gwendolyn's accuracy trend is the strongest in the cohort (78% → 88% → 98% in G6). If pacing increases, she has the skill trajectory to accelerate.

5. **Track Science test frequency weekly for the next 6 weeks — minimum 2 Science tests per week.** Create a visible tracking chart for Gwendolyn showing weekly Science test count and accuracy. Accountability on frequency, not just accuracy, is the key lever.
