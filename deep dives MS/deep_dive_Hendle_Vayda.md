## SECTION 2 — Course Progress & Effort

### Table 2.1 — Course Progress

| % Complete | Total XP Earned | Total XP Remaining | Time in Course (days) | Avg XP / School Day |
|------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| 47.2% | 786 | 878 | 71 | 38.4 |

**Rules**
- **Time in Course (days)**: 71 unique school days with recorded Science activity (across all Science enrollments this year).
- **Avg XP / School Day**: 2,724 total Science XP ÷ 71 days = 38.4 XP/day.
- **Current active course**: MobyMax - Science G4 (began 2025-11-26, ongoing). Prior courses: MobyMax - Science G3-5 (38.2% complete, ended 2025-11-26) and Science Hole-filling G4 (100% complete, ended 2025-12-18).
- Total Science XP earned across all enrollments this year: 2,906 (1,883 + 237 + 786).

## SECTION 3 — Assessment & Practice Signals

### Table 3.1 — Assessment & Practice

| Test Attempts | Last Test Date | Hole-Filling Attempts | Accuracy Trend | Fluency Signal |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 3 | 2025-12-18 | 1 (completed) | Declining | Below level |

**Science Test History:**

| Date | Test Grade | R90 | Accuracy | Attempt # | Effective? |
|------|-----------|-----|----------|-----------|------------|
| 2025-11-11 | G3 | 0 | 90.9% | 1 | Yes |
| 2025-12-05 | G4 | 0 | 66.7% | 1 | Yes |
| 2025-12-18 | G4 | 0 | 69.4% | 2 | Yes |

**Allowed Values**
- **Accuracy Trend**: Declining — Vayda scored 90.9% on G3 but dropped to 66.7% and 69.4% on G4 attempts. The R90 = 0 on both G4 tests means she has not demonstrated fluency at grade 4.
- **Fluency Signal**: Below level — R90 = 0 on both G4 standardized test attempts; she is 2 grade levels behind age grade in Science.
- **Hole-Filling**: Completed Science Hole-filling (G4) between attempts 1 and 2, but accuracy only improved marginally (66.7% → 69.4%).
- **Practice Accuracy**: 70.6% overall in daily Science practice (1,688 correct / 2,391 total questions).

## SECTION 4 — Learning Velocity & Growth

### Table 4.1 — Growth Metrics

| Growth X | Expected Growth X | Meets 2× Target? | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| 6.0 | 2.0 | Yes | Fall-to-Winter MAP growth of 12 RIT points (202 → 214) vs. projected ~2 points. Exceeds target by 3×. |

**Rules**
- **Growth X**: 6.0 — based on Student-Level Predictions data showing Fall 2025 RIT 202 → Winter 2026 RIT 214, with NWEA projected fall-to-winter growth of 2 RIT points.
- **MAP Growth Multiple (Fall-to-Fall)**: 2.67× per rpt2_map_scores (growth percentile 92nd).
- **Meets 2× Target?**: Yes — growth is well above the 2× threshold.
- Despite strong MAP growth, Vayda's HMG remains at G3 with G4 standardized test accuracy below passing threshold. The MAP growth reflects broad knowledge gains, but mastery of structured G4 content is still incomplete.

## SECTION 5 — MAP Growth Context

### Table 5.1 — MAP Profile

| MAP Science RIT | MAP Grade Band | Domains Missed | Alignment Risk |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| 214 (Winter 2026) | ~2–3 | Unknown — domain-level breakdown not available | Medium |

**Rules**
- **MAP Science RIT**: Most recent Winter 2026 score is 214; Fall 2025 was 208 (grade-level estimate 2.2).
- **MAP Grade Band**: RIT 214 places Vayda in approximately the late G2/early G3 band for Science, while she is age-grade 6.
- **Domains Missed**: Domain-level MAP data is not available in the current data exports. MAP Science assesses Life Science, Earth & Space Science, and Physical Science domains.
- **Alignment Risk**: Medium — Vayda is working in G4 MobyMax Science content, which covers foundational concepts that MAP samples. However, MAP assesses grade 6-level standards while Vayda's instruction is at G3-4 level, creating a gap between instructional content and MAP assessment targets.

## SECTION 6 — Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Root Cause

- **Accuracy constraint**

### Secondary Root Cause

- **Placement mismatch**

### Evidence

- Vayda scored 66.7% and 69.4% on her two G4 Science standardized test attempts (Table 3.1), both well below passing threshold despite completing hole-filling between attempts.
- Daily Science practice accuracy is 70.6% (Table 2 context), indicating persistent difficulty with G4 content — not just test performance.
- She passed the G3 test at 90.9% but dropped >20 percentage points on G4, suggesting the G3→G4 content jump is a significant barrier.
- Her HMG is G3 while age grade is 6, placing her 2 grade levels behind (Table 1.1). Despite strong MAP growth (6.0× in Table 4.1), the structured curriculum progression has stalled at the G3/G4 boundary.
- R90 = 0 on both G4 tests confirms she has not demonstrated any fluency at grade 4 level.

## SECTION 7 — Completion Projection

### Fixed Assumptions
- XP per day = **25**
- Days per week = **5**

### Table 7.1 — Projection

| XP Remaining | XP / Day Assumed | Days / Week | Weeks to Finish | Finish Before EOY? |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 878 | 25 | 5 | 8 | Yes |

**Rules**
- **XP Remaining**: 878 XP in current MobyMax - Science G4 course.
- **Weeks to Finish**: 878 ÷ (25 × 5) = 878 ÷ 125 = 7.02, rounded **up** = **8 weeks**.
- **Finish Before EOY?**: Yes — 8 weeks from now (mid-April 2026) is before end of year. However, this only projects completing G4 content. Passing the G4 standardized test is not guaranteed given her current accuracy (69.4%).
- **Note**: Vayda's actual Science XP pace (38.4 XP/day) exceeds the assumed 25 XP/day, so she may finish G4 content sooner. The real bottleneck is accuracy, not pace.

## SECTION 8 — Intervention Levers

### Actions

1. **Review G4 Science concepts where Vayda scores lowest** — Analyze her practice question data to identify specific G4 Science topics (e.g., energy transfer, earth processes, ecosystems) where accuracy is below 65%, and assign targeted re-teaching within 1 week.
2. **Add a second round of G4 hole-filling before the next standardized test attempt** — Her first hole-filling only improved test accuracy by 2.7 points (66.7% → 69.4%). A more targeted remediation pass focused on weak domains should be assigned before her 3rd attempt.
3. **Increase Science instructional time to close the accuracy gap** — Vayda averages 49 minutes/day in Science. Consider adding 15 minutes of focused practice on her weakest G4 topics to build deeper understanding.
4. **Schedule a G4 standardized test re-attempt by mid-March 2026** — After completing targeted hole-filling, re-test within 3–4 weeks to assess whether remediation improved accuracy above the passing threshold.
5. **Monitor daily practice accuracy weekly** — If practice accuracy does not rise above 75% within 2 weeks, consider whether G4 content needs to be broken into smaller scaffolded units before re-testing.
