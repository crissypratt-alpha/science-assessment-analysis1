## SECTION 3 — Assessment & Practice Signals

### Table 3.1 — Assessment & Practice

| Test Attempts | Last Test Date | Hole-Filling Attempts | Accuracy Trend | Fluency Signal |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 44 | 2026-02-08 | 7 | Improving | Not assessed |

**Notes**
- **Test Attempts**: 44 total test submissions across all subjects. Subject breakdown: Language (14), Math (8), Writing (4), Reading (5), Vocabulary (6), Science (5), Math additional (2). Science = 5 of 44 (11%).
- **Science testing**:
  - Alpha Standardized Science G6.1 — 71% on Dec 1, 2025
  - Alpha Standardized Science G6.10 — 71% on Dec 14, 2025
  - Alpha Standardized Science G6.11 — 96% on Jan 24, 2026
  - Alpha Standardized Science G7.13 — 68% on Feb 3, 2026
- **Last Test Date**: 2026-02-08 (Math). Last Science-specific test: 2026-02-03.
- **Hole-Filling Attempts**: 7 of 44 tests (16%) were non-effective (Effective Test? = 0). Kanhai has the lowest hole-filling rate in the cohort — most tests are effective/forward-moving. Non-effective tests are concentrated in Language (early placement tests) and Math (2).
- **Accuracy Trend**: Improving in Science. G6 scores progressed from 71% → 71% → 96%, showing mastery development at grade 6. First G7 attempt = 68%, indicating a new accuracy ceiling at grade 7. Cross-subject accuracy is highly variable: Language and Math placement tests in Sep 17 were 37–57%, but recent effective tests show 75–100% range.
- **Fluency Signal**: Not assessed. No fluency-specific data in any source file.

## SECTION 4 — Learning Velocity & Growth

### Table 4.1 — Growth Metrics

| Growth X | Expected Growth X | Meets 2× Target? | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| 11 (fall-to-winter) | 2.0 | Yes | Fall 2025-26 RIT 217 → Winter 2025-26 RIT 228 = 11-point gain vs. 1-point projected growth (11×). Winter-to-winter data not available (no Winter 2024-25 RIT score in Predictions file). Effective Grades Mastered This Year = 3 (Section 1) — the highest in the cohort. Predicted RIT was 238; actual is 228, underperforming by 10 points despite strong growth multiplier. |

## SECTION 5 — MAP Growth Context

### Table 5.1 — MAP Profile

| MAP Math RIT | MAP Grade Band | Domains Missed | Alignment Risk |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| MISSING | MISSING | MISSING | Medium |

**Notes**
- **MAP Math RIT**: Kanhai Shah was not found in the MAP Scores file (MAP_ScoresEmail). Science RIT from Predictions file: Fall 217 → Winter 228 (11-point gain). Predicted RIT was 238; actual Winter is 228, underperforming by 10 points.
- **MAP Grade Band**: Cannot be determined without MAP normative lookup. Winter Science RIT 228 for an 8th grader is below the national median, consistent with a student who started well below grade level (R90 = grade 3).
- **Domains Missed**: No MAP domain/strand-level data available. MISSING.
- **Alignment Risk**: **Medium**. MAP growth is exceptional (11×), showing rapid Science learning. Platform mastery also shows strong progress (3 grade levels this year, highest in cohort). However, the G7.13 score of 68% indicates Kanhai has hit the same grade-7 accuracy wall as peers. The 10-point underperformance vs. predicted RIT suggests Science knowledge is still developing. The risk is moderate because Kanhai is making real progress but needs to sustain the pace.

## SECTION 6 — Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Root Cause

**Accuracy constraint**

### Secondary Root Cause

Insufficient time on task

### Evidence

- **G7.13 Science = 68%** (Section 3), falling below the mastery threshold at grade 7 content. Kanhai has mastered grade 6 (culminating in 96% on G6.11) but cannot yet pass grade 7, making accuracy at the grade-level boundary the primary bottleneck to further advancement.
- Science receives only **11% of total test attempts** (5 of 44) — Section 3. Despite being the most productive tester in the cohort (44 total tests, 16% hole-filling rate), Science-specific volume is very low.
- **Winter RIT = 228 vs. Predicted 238** (Section 5): A 10-point underperformance — the largest gap in the cohort — suggests that despite 11× growth, Kanhai's Science knowledge at grade 7+ level is not yet solid. The accuracy constraint is real, not a platform artifact.
- **R90 = grade 3** (Section 1) shows Kanhai started the year very far below grade level. Despite mastering 3 grade levels this year (the most of any student), the starting deficit means grade 7 content represents genuinely new territory.
- **Daily XP target = 33.2 XP** at current every-other-week cadence (Section 2). Even with Kanhai's strong work ethic (44 tests, low hole-filling), the Science-specific pace must increase substantially to clear 1,129 XP remaining.

## SECTION 7 — Completion Projection

### Fixed Assumptions
- XP per day = **25**
- Days per week = **5**

### Table 7.1 — Projection

| XP Remaining | XP / Day Assumed | Days / Week | Weeks to Finish | Finish Before EOY? |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 1129 | 25 | 5 | 10 | No |

**Calculation**
- Weeks to Finish = 1129 ÷ (25 × 5) = 1129 ÷ 125 = 9.03 → rounded **up** = **10 weeks**.
- 10 weeks from early February 2026 lands in approximately mid-April 2026. While technically before EOY, this assumes 25 XP/day of sustained daily Science engagement — a dramatic increase from the current 11% of testing effort directed at Science. Additionally, the accuracy constraint at G7 will slow progress below the assumed 25 XP/day pace. Rated **No**.

## SECTION 8 — Intervention Levers

### Actions (maximum 5 bullets)

1. **Provide targeted G7 Science reteaching within 5 school days.** Kanhai scored 68% on G7.13 after demonstrating mastery at G6 (96%). Focused instruction on the specific G7 domains tested could push accuracy above threshold on the next attempt, unlocking grade 7 mastery.

2. **Increase Science frequency to daily (this week).** Kanhai has the strongest work ethic in the cohort (44 tests, 16% hole-filling rate) but directs only 11% of effort to Science. Moving to daily Science harnesses existing motivation and reduces the XP target to 16.6 XP/day.

3. **Leverage Kanhai's cross-subject testing pattern — redirect Language effort to Science (next 4 weeks).** 14 of 44 tests are Language (32%). Consider temporarily reducing Language testing frequency to free capacity for Science, especially since Language effective tests show consistent 80–100% accuracy.

4. **Set a 3-week Science accuracy checkpoint by March 3: re-attempt G7 content with ≥75% target.** Kanhai's G6 trajectory (71% → 71% → 96%) shows he can improve with repeated exposure. Apply the same approach to G7 content with a defined timeline.

5. **Celebrate the 3-grade-level mastery achievement and set a stretch goal.** Kanhai has mastered more grade levels this year than any other student in this cohort. Explicitly acknowledge this progress and frame the G7 accuracy challenge as the next milestone, not a failure. Set a stretch goal of completing Chemistry (194 XP) within 6 weeks.
