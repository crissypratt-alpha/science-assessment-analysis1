## SECTION 3 — Assessment & Practice Signals (All Subjects)

### Table 3.1 — Assessment & Practice

| Subject | Accuracy (All-Time) | Accuracy (YTD 2026) | Active Days | Last Activity Date | Fluency Signal |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Math | 90.3% (93/103) | 87.5% | 54 | 2026-02-17 | Not assessed |
| Language | 82.5% (2631/3189) | 71.5% | 86 | 2026-02-17 | Not assessed |
| Reading | 91.7% (4673/5096) | 77.1% | 41 | 2026-02-09 | Not assessed |
| FastMath | 90.8% (20028/22066) | 91.8% | 95 | 2026-02-17 | Below level (working G5, age grade 4 — but see note) |
| Science | 62.9% (44/70) | 65.0% | 5 | 2026-02-11 | Not assessed |
| Vocabulary | 85.5% (36645/42840) | 85.9% | 35 | 2026-02-17 | Not assessed |

**Notes**
- **Accuracy Trends**: Language accuracy has **declined** from 89.6% at grade K-2 to 75.3% at grade 3. Reading has **declined** from 94.1% at G1 to 79.6% at G3. Science is at 62.9% — dangerously low and below any mastery threshold. Math is stable at ~89%.
- **FastMath by grade**: G1 92.7%, G2 91.8%, G4 80.7% (dropped significantly), G5 92.5% (recovered). The G4 dip (80.7% on 2,634 questions) is notable — she may have gaps in G4 FastMath content despite being enrolled in G5.
- **Science detail**: Only 5 active days ever. Question counts: 0 (Nov 10), 4/5 (Jan 15), 22/23 (Jan 24), 4/5 (Jan 30), 4/5 (Feb 11). Only 1 day had meaningful question volume. Total: 34/38 on those 4 question-days = 89.5% when she actually engages. The 62.9% overall (44/70) includes a batch with lower accuracy suggesting the diagnostic/placement content was harder.
- **Language at G3**: 1,191/1,582 correct (75.3%). This is the weakest accuracy of any core subject at current grade level and suggests genuine content gaps in G3 Language.

## SECTION 4 — Learning Velocity & Growth

### Table 4.1 — Growth Metrics

| Subject | Growth X | Expected Growth X | Meets 2x Target? | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| Math | MISSING (no winter MAP) | 2.0 | MISSING | Fall MAP RIT 196 (grade equivalent 1.2, 51st percentile). No winter MAP score available to compute growth. Platform mastery: moved from G1 to working in G3 since Aug — roughly 2 grade levels in 6 months on platform, though HMG is still 2. |
| Language | MISSING (no winter MAP) | 2.0 | MISSING | Fall MAP RIT 199 (grade equivalent 1.4, 62nd percentile). No winter MAP available. Platform mastery: HMG = 2, working in G3. |
| Reading | MISSING (no winter MAP) | 2.0 | MISSING | Fall MAP RIT 210 (grade equivalent 2.6, 79th percentile). No winter MAP available. Strongest MAP score relative to grade, but Reading attendance is only 30.6%. |
| Science | MISSING (no winter MAP) | 2.0 | MISSING | Fall MAP RIT 194 (grade equivalent below K, 49th percentile). Essentially no platform progress — 5 active days, no grade mastered. |

**Notes**
- No winter MAP scores exist for Olivia. Growth multiples cannot be computed. This is a **critical data gap**.
- Platform velocity: Math is the strongest performer — 70.6% through G3 Zearn with consistent effort (68% attendance). Language and Reading have reached G3 content but mastery is stalled at G2. Science has barely been touched.

## SECTION 5 — MAP Growth Context

### Table 5.1 — MAP Profile

| Subject | MAP RIT (Fall) | MAP Grade Level Estimate | Achievement Percentile | Alignment Risk |
|---------|---------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Math | 196 | 1.2 | 51st | High |
| Language | 199 | 1.4 | 62nd | High |
| Reading | 210 | 2.6 | 79th | Medium |
| Science | 194 | Below K | 49th | High |

**Notes**
- **No winter MAP scores**: Cannot assess growth trajectory. The Fall scores establish baseline only.
- **Math alignment risk = High**: MAP places Olivia at grade 1.2 equivalent. She is working in G3 Zearn (89% accuracy), which is good platform performance, but we have no MAP confirmation that this work is translating to RIT growth. The gap between MAP 1.2 and platform G3 may indicate the curriculum isn't addressing MAP-assessed domains.
- **Language alignment risk = High**: MAP grade equivalent 1.4, platform working in G3. Language G3 accuracy has dropped to 75.3%, consistent with the MAP signal that her actual Language level is well below G3.
- **Reading alignment risk = Medium**: MAP grade equivalent 2.6 is closest to her platform placement (working in G3). Reading accuracy at G3 is 79.6%, which is credible for someone slightly below grade level.
- **Science alignment risk = High**: MAP grade equivalent below K (RIT 194). With only 5 active days and no grade mastered, there is zero meaningful Science instruction happening. MAP and platform are both signaling a massive gap.

## SECTION 6 — Root Cause Analysis

### Root Cause Bucket A — Motivational Problems

**A1. Insufficient time on task (Science)**
- Science: 5 active days out of 52 available school days (5.8% attendance). Total Science active minutes: 98 min across the entire year. At current pace (~20 min/active day, 1 day per 2 weeks), Science progress is essentially zero.
- Evidence: 97 total XP earned in Science (Section 2). No grade mastered (Section 1). Only 4 days with any question attempts (Section 3).

**A2. Insufficient time on task (Reading)**
- Reading: 38 active days out of 124 available school days (30.6% attendance). YTD 2026 Reading XP = 342 across 7 weeks. Reading has dropped to 0 active days in the last 2 weeks (weeks of Feb 9 and Feb 16).
- Evidence: Section 2 attendance rate. Weekly data shows Reading engagement declining — from 128 XP/week (Jan 19) to 0 XP for the last 2 weeks.

**A3. Excessive FastMath waste time**
- 1,711 minutes wasted in FastMath (53.5% of all FastMath time). Multiple days with 60-153 minutes of waste — far exceeding the 10-minute daily goal.
- Worst days: Oct 15 (153 min waste, 36 min active), Sep 25 (140 min waste, 59 min active), Sep 22 (121 min waste, 8 min active). On Sep 22, she wasted 121 minutes while only producing 9 XP.
- Evidence: Section 2 waste data, top 30 waste days. This waste is concentrated in Sep-Oct but continues into 2026 (96 min waste YTD with only 331 min active = 22.5% waste rate, improving but still significant).

### Root Cause Bucket B — Individual Academic Problems

**B1. Placement mismatch — Language G3 content is too hard**
- Language accuracy has dropped from 89.6% at K-2 level to 75.3% at G3 level. MAP Language RIT 199 (grade equivalent 1.4) confirms she is performing at roughly a mid-1st grade level in Language. Placing her in G3 Language content when MAP says 1.4 creates a 1.5+ grade gap.
- Evidence: Section 3 accuracy by grade level, Section 5 MAP grade equivalent.

**B2. Science content gap — cannot pass G3 at mastery threshold**
- Overall Science accuracy is 62.9% (44/70 questions). With no grade mastered and working grade level = 0 (Section 1 mastery data), Science onboarding was never completed. She was placed directly into G3 Science content without establishing baseline mastery.
- Evidence: Mastery table shows `onboarding_complete_date = null` for Science. HMG = null. When she does engage, her accuracy on small samples (Jan 24: 22/23 = 95.7%) suggests the content isn't inherently too hard — the problem is she rarely touches it at all.

**B3. FastMath G4 accuracy dip signals gap**
- FastMath G4 accuracy = 80.7% vs G2 (91.8%) and G5 (92.5%). This non-monotonic pattern (high → low → high) on 2,634 questions at G4 suggests a specific skills gap in G4 FastMath content (likely multiplication/division fluency). She may have been advanced past G4 without true mastery.
- Evidence: Section 3 FastMath accuracy by grade level. 80.7% on a large sample is a reliable signal.

### Root Cause Bucket C — Systemic Academic Problems

**C1. No winter MAP test administered — growth is unmeasurable**
- Olivia has Fall-only MAP scores across all 4 tested subjects. Without winter MAP data, it is impossible to verify whether 6 months of platform work has translated into RIT growth. There is no accountability mechanism for whether the curriculum is working.
- Evidence: Section 4 — all growth multiples are MISSING. Section 5 — only Fall scores exist.

**C2. Reading course sequencing may not align with MAP-tested skills**
- Olivia completed ClearFluency G1 (25%), was moved to ClearFluency G2 (0% — no earned XP), then placed in Core Knowledge Reading G3/3 (49.8%). She appears to have been moved through courses without completing them. ClearFluency G1 was only 25% complete with 225 XP earned before being ended (Oct 29-Nov 4). The Reading curriculum jump from fluency-focused (ClearFluency) to content-knowledge-focused (Core Knowledge) without completing the fluency work may leave gaps.
- Evidence: Enrollment history shows ClearFluency G1 ended Nov 4 at 25% complete, ClearFluency G2 ended Nov 12 at 0%, Core Knowledge Reading G3/3 started Nov 13.

**C3. Science curriculum barely exists for this student**
- Science enrollment started Nov 10 — 3 months into the school year. The course sequence went: MobyMax Science G3-5 (0% complete, ended Nov 24) → MobyMax Science G3 (0% complete, ended Dec 11) → Science Hole-filling G3 (66.7%, current). Multiple Science courses were opened and closed within days with 0% completion. The current course is a hole-filling course with only 78 total XP. There is no substantive Science curriculum in place.
- Evidence: Enrollment data shows 3 Science courses, 2 with 0% completion and end dates within 2 weeks of start. Current Science course has only 78 total XP (trivially small).

## SECTION 7 — Completion Projection

### Fixed Assumptions
- XP per day = **25**
- Days per week = **5**

### Table 7.1 — Projection by Subject

| Subject | Current Course | XP Remaining | XP / Day Assumed | Days / Week | Weeks to Finish Current Course | Finish Before EOY? |
|---------|---------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| Math | Zearn G3 | 640 | 25 | 5 | 6 | Yes |
| Reading | Core Knowledge Reading G3/3 | 786 | 25 | 5 | 7 | Yes |
| FastMath | AlphaNumbers G5 | 218 | 10 (subject default) | 5 | 5 | Yes |
| Science | Science Hole-filling G3 | 26 | 13 (subject default) | 5 | 1 | Yes (but trivial — only hole-filling) |
| Language | MobyMax Lang 3 Hole-Filling | 0 | 25 | 5 | 0 (complete) | Yes (but no next course assigned) |
| Vocabulary | Vocab G3 Hole-Filling | 260 | 10 (subject default) | 5 | 6 | Yes |

**Notes**
- At 25 XP/day (Math, Reading), current courses are finishable. **But completing G3 courses does not solve the underlying problem** — Olivia is a grade 4 student with HMG = 2 and MAP scores at grade 1-2 level. Finishing G3 courses gets her to on-grade-level at best, but only if the material actually sticks (no winter MAP to confirm).
- **Science projection is misleading**: The current Science course has only 26 XP remaining (a few questions of hole-filling). There is no substantive Science course queued. After this hole-filling is done, Science instruction will go to zero unless a new course is assigned.
- **Language has no next course**: Current hole-filling is 100% complete. No new Language course is active. Language instruction will stall without assignment.
- **64 school days remain** through approximately mid-June.

## SECTION 8 — Intervention Levers

### Actions (maximum 5 bullets)

1. **Administer winter MAP immediately across all 4 subjects (this week).** Olivia has been on platform 6 months with zero post-baseline MAP testing. Without winter scores, we cannot determine if curriculum is producing RIT growth. This is the single most important action — every other decision depends on knowing whether the work is translating to measurable outcomes.

2. **Assign a substantive Science course and set a minimum of 3 Science days/week (within 5 school days).** Science has had 5 active days all year and no grade mastered. The current course is 26 XP of hole-filling — effectively nothing. Assign MobyMax Science G3 (or equivalent) with a clear schedule. Science attendance must move from 5.8% to at least 60%.

3. **Re-assess Language placement; consider stepping back to G2 content (within 2 weeks, pending MAP results).** Language G3 accuracy is 75.3% while MAP places her at grade 1.4. If winter MAP confirms Language is still at ~G1-2, continuing G3 content is counterproductive. She needs to build fluency at G2 before advancing. Assign a G2 Language course if MAP confirms the gap.

4. **Investigate and remediate FastMath waste time (this week).** 1,711 minutes wasted (53.5% of all FastMath time). This likely represents tab-idling, screen-on-but-not-working, or other off-task behavior. Conference with student and/or set up monitoring. Even though waste has improved from ~50% in Fall to ~23% in Jan-Feb, 96 wasted minutes YTD is still ~2 hours of lost learning. Set a ceiling of 15 min total time per FastMath session (active + waste) to force focus.

5. **Assign a next Language course and a next Reading course so instruction doesn't stall upon current course completion (within 1 week).** Language hole-filling is 100% complete with no successor course. Reading is at 49.8% and will finish in ~7 weeks. Have the next courses in the sequence ready. For Language, consider whether G3 mainline or G2 reinforcement is appropriate based on winter MAP results.
