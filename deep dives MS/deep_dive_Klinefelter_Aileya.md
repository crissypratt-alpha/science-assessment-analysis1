## SECTION 1 — Student Snapshot

### Table 1.1 — Student Snapshot

| Student | Campus | Enrollment Grade | Current Course | Age Grade | Course Grade | Highest Mastered Grade (HMG) |
|--------|--------|------------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Aileya Klinefelter | Alpha School Austin | 8 | Nice Academy - Middle School Science Supplementary Course | 8 | 6 - 8 | 7 |

**Definitions**
- **Enrollment Grade**: grade level assigned by enrollment — 8.
- **Age Grade**: chronological grade level — 8.
- **Course Grade**: nominal grade level of the current course — 6 - 8 (multi-grade span). The Supplementary Course is a curated review/enrichment course covering middle school science topics.
- **HMG**: highest fully mastered grade level (not "working in") — 7. Aileya mastered Science Grade 7 on Feb 4, 2025. She is currently working in grade 8 content (Knowledge Grade = 8) but the platform's Effective Grade = 5, indicating a significant gap between assigned content and demonstrated mastery this year.

## SECTION 2 — Course Progress & Effort

### Table 2.1 — Course Progress

| % Complete | Total XP Earned | Total XP Remaining | Time in Course (days) | Avg XP / School Day |
|------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| 66% | 234 | 121 | ~5 | 7.8 |

**Notes**
- **% Complete**: 66% of the Nice Academy - Middle School Science Supplementary Course (234 of ~355 total XP).
- **Total XP Remaining**: 121 XP in the current course. TimeBack Learning Report confirms 121 XP remaining and "2 weeks to complete if meeting daily goal."
- **Total XP Earned (session)**: The Learning Report's XP Goal Achievement table shows 413 total Science XP earned this session (Jan 5 – Feb 16, 2026) at 125% of her 12.5 XP/day Science goal. The 234 XP figure reflects the current Supplementary Course specifically; the remaining 179 XP likely reflects XP from a previous Science course completed earlier in the session.
- **Time in Course (days)**: Estimated ~5 unique school days with Science activity based on 234 XP earned ÷ ~47 XP/active-day (derived from 57 total active minutes across ~5 sessions averaging ~11 min each). TimeBack shows 57 active minutes total in this course.
- **Avg XP / School Day**: Using the session-level data — 413 Science XP earned over 30 school days in the session (Jan 5 – Feb 16) = 13.8 XP/day. Using only the current course: 234 XP ÷ ~30 days = 7.8 XP/day. Her Science daily goal is 12.5 XP; she is at 125% of goal per the Learning Report.

## SECTION 3 — Assessment & Practice Signals

### Table 3.1 — Assessment & Practice

| Test Attempts | Last Test Date | Hole-Filling Attempts | Accuracy Trend | Fluency Signal |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 0 | N/A | 0 | Insufficient data | Not assessed |

**Notes**
- **Test Attempts**: Aileya has **0 Science test records** in the Test Results file. All 30 of her test submissions across the session are in Math (7), Writing (8), Vocabulary (7), Reading (5), and Language (3). No Science tests were logged.
- **Last Test Date**: No Science test on record. Her most recent test of any subject was Jan 29, 2026 (Reading).
- **Hole-Filling Attempts**: The Supplementary Course itself functions as a review/enrichment course rather than a primary progression course, so it is not structured around the traditional test–mastery–advance cycle.
- **Accuracy Trend**: Insufficient data. No Science-specific tests exist to establish a trend. The TimeBack Learning Report shows an overall Science accuracy of approximately 77%, which is below the 80% optimal learning zone floor but above 60%.
- **Fluency Signal**: Not assessed. No fluency-specific data exists for Science.

## SECTION 4 — Learning Velocity & Growth

### Table 4.1 — Growth Metrics

| Growth X | Expected Growth X | Meets 2× Target? | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| 2.0 (MAP Learning Report) | 2.0 | Yes | MAP Science Growth X = 2.0 per the Learning Report (Fall 25-26 data), meeting the 2× target exactly. However, the Predictions file shows a more concerning picture: Winter 2024-25 RIT = 234 → Fall 2025-26 RIT = 229 → Winter 2025-26 RIT = 226. This is a **-4 point winter-to-winter decline** against a predicted +4 growth, and a **-3 point fall-to-winter decline** against predicted +4 growth. The discrepancy between the Learning Report Growth X (2.0) and the Predictions file (negative growth) may reflect different MAP test administrations or calculation windows. The RIT decline is the more actionable signal. |

## SECTION 5 — MAP Growth Context

### Table 5.1 — MAP Profile

| MAP Math RIT | MAP Grade Band | Domains Missed | Alignment Risk |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| 226 (Science RIT, Winter 25-26) | MISSING | MISSING | Medium |

**Notes**
- **MAP Science RIT**: 226 (Winter 2025-26). This represents a decline from 234 (Winter 2024-25) and 229 (Fall 2025-26). Achievement Percentile = 92nd per the Learning Report, indicating Aileya still performs well relative to national peers despite the decline.
- **MAP Grade Band**: Not available in the MAP Scores file — Aileya does not appear in that dataset. The 92nd percentile suggests she is performing at or above grade level nationally.
- **Domains Missed**: No MAP domain/strand-level data available. MISSING.
- **Alignment Risk**: **Medium**. Aileya's MAP Achievement Percentile (92nd) and Knowledge Grade (8) suggest strong science ability, and she is 66% through her current course and on track for daily XP goals. However, the declining RIT scores (-4 points winter-to-winter) and the fact that the Supplementary Course is a review course — not a primary progression course — raises a question about whether the curriculum is stretching her appropriately. HMG = 7 was mastered nearly a year ago (Feb 2025) with no new grade mastered since.

## SECTION 6 — Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Root Cause

**Coasting / low intensity**

### Secondary Root Cause

MAP–curriculum misalignment

### Evidence

- **Declining MAP RIT despite On Track XP performance** (Section 4): Aileya's MAP Science RIT has fallen from 234 → 229 → 226 over 12 months, a -4 point winter-to-winter decline, while simultaneously earning 125% of her daily Science XP goal (Section 2). This pattern — meeting XP targets while losing ground on external assessment — is the hallmark of coasting: accumulating platform credit without deepening understanding.
- **Supplementary Course placement** (Section 1): Aileya is enrolled in the "Supplementary Course" (review/enrichment) rather than a primary progression course (biology, chemistry, physics, or Earth & space). With HMG = 7 mastered a year ago and Knowledge Grade = 8, she may have exhausted the progression value of this review course and needs to be moved to a content-advancing course.
- **Zero Science tests on record** (Section 3): Despite 30 test submissions across other subjects, Aileya has taken 0 Science tests. The Supplementary Course may not require or generate test records, which means the platform has no mastery-check data to drive progression. Her Effective Grades Mastered This Year = 0 (Progress Tracker) confirms no forward mastery movement.
- **Low active minutes relative to XP** (Section 2): 234 XP in only 57 active minutes yields a rate of 4.1 XP/min — far above the typical 0.7–1.4 XP/min for most middle school science courses (see course breakdown data). This suggests the Supplementary Course awards XP at a high rate relative to effort, which may inflate On Track metrics without proportional learning.
- **Science accuracy at 77%** (Section 3): Below the 80% optimal learning zone, suggesting the content she encounters is appropriately challenging, but the lack of test-driven progression means she is not being pushed through the mastery cycle.

## SECTION 7 — Completion Projection

### Fixed Assumptions
- XP per day = **25**
- Days per week = **5**

### Table 7.1 — Projection

| XP Remaining | XP / Day Assumed | Days / Week | Weeks to Finish | Finish Before EOY? |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 121 | 25 | 5 | 1 | Yes |

**Calculation**
- Weeks to Finish = 121 ÷ (25 × 5) = 121 ÷ 125 = 0.97 → rounded **up** = **1 week**.
- At the standard 25 XP/day pace, Aileya will finish the Supplementary Course within 1 week. Even at her current course-specific pace of ~7.8 XP/day, she would finish in approximately 3 weeks.
- **However**: Finishing the Supplementary Course does not complete all MS Science. If the goal includes progressing through remaining MS Science courses (biology, chemistry, physics, Earth & space), additional XP would be required. The Supplementary Course appears to be an independent enrichment module.

## SECTION 8 — Intervention Levers

### Actions (maximum 5 bullets)

1. **Transition Aileya to a primary progression course (biology, chemistry, or physics) within 1 week of Supplementary Course completion.** She is 66% through the Supplementary Course and will likely finish it within 1–3 weeks. Have the next course queued and ready to assign immediately so no science time is lost.

2. **Investigate the MAP RIT decline (234 → 226) within 5 school days.** A -4 point winter-to-winter drop at the 92nd percentile warrants a closer look. Review whether the decline reflects a bad test day, test anxiety, or genuine knowledge erosion. Consider re-administering MAP Science if the winter score seems anomalous.

3. **Introduce Science-specific mastery tests within the next 2 weeks.** Aileya has 0 Science tests on record despite 413 Science XP earned this session. Without test data, the platform cannot validate mastery or identify knowledge gaps. Assign at least one grade-level mastery test (Grade 7 or 8) to benchmark her current level.

4. **Increase Science daily XP goal from 12.5 to 25 XP/day once she transitions to a primary progression course.** The current 12.5 XP/day goal, while met at 125%, is half the standard rate. Aileya's high MAP Achievement Percentile (92nd) and Knowledge Grade (8) suggest she can handle a more demanding pace. Doubling the goal ensures sufficient velocity to make real progress in a new course before EOY.

5. **Review Effective Grade (5) vs Knowledge Grade (8) discrepancy with the curriculum team within 10 school days.** A 3-grade gap between Effective Grade and Knowledge Grade suggests the platform may not be accurately tracking her true level, or that she has gaps in foundational content despite strong MAP performance. Clarify whether this gap reflects real skill deficits or a data/placement artifact.
