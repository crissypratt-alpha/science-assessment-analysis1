# Deep Dive — Parker Pesek

---

## SECTION 1 — Student Snapshot

### Table 1.1 — Student Snapshot

| Student | Campus | Enrollment Grade | Current Course | Age Grade | Course Grade | Highest Mastered Grade (HMG) |
|--------|--------|------------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Parker Pesek | Alpha School Austin | 8 | Nice Academy - Middle school chemistry | 8 | 6 - 8 | 6 |

**Definitions**
- **Enrollment Grade**: grade level assigned by enrollment — 8.
- **Age Grade**: chronological grade level — 8.
- **Course Grade**: nominal grade level of the current course — 6 - 8 (multi-grade span).
- **HMG**: highest fully mastered grade level (not "working in") — 6. Parker is currently working in grade 7 content (Knowledge Grade = 7, Effective Grade = 7) but has not yet fully mastered it.

## SECTION 2 — Course Progress & Effort

### Table 2.1 — Course Progress

| % Complete | Total XP Earned | Total XP Remaining | Time in Course (days) | Avg XP / School Day |
|------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| 70% | MISSING | 1039 (total MS Science) | 12 | 12.5 |

**Notes**
- **% Complete**: 70% of MS Chemistry (current course). XP remaining in current course = 104 XP.
- **Total XP Remaining**: 1,039 XP to complete all middle school science (104 XP in current course + 340 XP Physics + 240 XP Earth & Space Science + 355 XP Supplementary Course).
- **Time in Course (days)**: 12 unique school days with recorded test activity across all subjects. Only 1 of those days included a Science-specific test.
- **Avg XP / School Day**: 12.5 XP/day in Science. Daily target if science remains every other week = 30.6 XP; daily target if science was daily = 15.3 XP. Current pace is below both targets.

## SECTION 3 — Assessment & Practice Signals

### Table 3.1 — Assessment & Practice

| Test Attempts | Last Test Date | Hole-Filling Attempts | Accuracy Trend | Fluency Signal |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 17 | 2026-01-13 | 8 | Flat | Not assessed |

**Notes**
- **Test Attempts**: 17 total test submissions across all subjects. Subject breakdown: Writing (5), Vocabulary (4), Math (2), Reading (2), Language (2), Science (1). Only 1 of 17 attempts was in the enrolled Science course.
- **Science testing**: Alpha Standardized Science G7.13 — 73% on Dec 15, 2025. This is the sole Science test this school year.
- **Last Test Date**: 2026-01-13 (Language test). Last Science-specific test: 2025-12-15.
- **Hole-Filling Attempts**: 8 of 17 tests (47%) were non-effective (Effective Test? = 0), indicating remediation activity rather than forward progression. Concentrated in Writing (5), Vocabulary (1), and Math (2).
- **Accuracy Trend**: Flat. Effective-test accuracy ranges from 60% to 95% with no sustained upward or downward trajectory. Recent effective tests (Dec–Jan) cluster in the 73–85% range; overall effective-test average is 77.0%.
- **Fluency Signal**: Not assessed. No fluency-specific data exists in any source file.

## SECTION 4 — Learning Velocity & Growth

### Table 4.1 — Growth Metrics

| Growth X | Expected Growth X | Meets 2× Target? | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| 5.5 (winter-to-winter) | 2.0 | Yes | Winter 2024-25 RIT 226 → Winter 2025-26 RIT 237 = 11-point gain vs. 2-point projected growth (5.5×). However, Fall-to-Winter 2025-26 Growth X = 0 (RIT held flat at 237). Nearly all gains occurred before Fall 2025-26; recent momentum has stalled. Only 1 Science test taken this year (Section 3) severely limits the platform's ability to register growth. |

## SECTION 5 — MAP Growth Context

### Table 5.1 — MAP Profile

| MAP Math RIT | MAP Grade Band | Domains Missed | Alignment Risk |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| MISSING | MISSING | MISSING | High |

**Notes**
- **MAP Math RIT**: Parker Pesek was not found in the MAP Scores file (MAP_ScoresEmail). Science RIT from Predictions file: Fall 237 → Winter 237 (no growth).
- **MAP Grade Band**: Cannot be determined without the specific MAP normative lookup from the MAP Scores file. Science RIT of 237 is well above the 8th-grade national median.
- **Domains Missed**: No MAP domain/strand-level data available. MISSING.
- **Alignment Risk**: **High**. MAP Science RIT (237) suggests strong science reasoning ability, yet platform HMG is only grade 6 and Effective Grades Mastered This Year = 0. Only 1 Science test in ~5 months means the platform has had almost no data to advance mastery.

---

## SECTION 6 — Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Root Cause

**Insufficient time on task**

### Secondary Root Cause

MAP–curriculum misalignment

### Evidence

- Parker has taken only **1 Science test** out of 17 total test attempts (Section 3), meaning 94% of testing effort has been directed to non-Science subjects. The enrolled course (Middle school chemistry) has received negligible Science-specific attention.
- **Science XP pace = 12.5 XP/day** (Section 2), well below both the every-other-week target (30.6 XP/day) and the daily target (15.3 XP/day). At current pace, Parker needs 84 instructional days to finish all MS Science — more time than likely remains in the year.
- **Effective Grades Mastered This Year = 0** (Section 1), confirming the lack of Science engagement has translated into zero forward mastery progress this school year, despite being 70% through the current course.
- **Fall-to-Winter Growth X = 0** (Section 4) — RIT held flat at 237 from Fall to Winter 2025-26, indicating stalled growth coinciding with the period of minimal Science testing.
- **Alignment Risk = High** (Section 5): MAP RIT of 237 suggests Parker has above-grade-level Science reasoning, yet the platform reflects HMG = 6. The platform has not had the test data to unlock higher mastery levels — insufficient engagement, not ability, is the bottleneck.
- **47% of all tests are hole-filling** (Section 3), suggesting time is being consumed by remediation in other subjects rather than advancing in the enrolled Science course.

## SECTION 7 — Completion Projection

### Fixed Assumptions
- XP per day = **25**
- Days per week = **5**

### Table 7.1 — Projection

| XP Remaining | XP / Day Assumed | Days / Week | Weeks to Finish | Finish Before EOY? |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 1039 | 25 | 5 | 9 | Borderline |

**Calculation**
- Weeks to Finish = 1039 ÷ (25 × 5) = 1039 ÷ 125 = 8.31 → rounded **up** = **9 weeks**.
- 9 weeks from early February 2026 lands in approximately mid-April 2026. If the school year ends in late May / early June, this is technically feasible but assumes **daily Science engagement at 25 XP/day**, which is double Parker's current pace of 12.5 XP/day. Rated **Borderline**.

## SECTION 8 — Intervention Levers

### Actions (maximum 5 bullets)

1. **Increase Science frequency to daily immediately (this week).** At the current every-other-week cadence, Parker's 12.5 XP/day pace falls far short. Moving to daily Science yields a required target of 15.3 XP/day — achievable if engagement is sustained.

2. **Reduce cross-subject hole-filling during Science blocks (next 2 weeks).** 47% of all test attempts are non-effective hole-filling in Writing, Vocabulary, and Math. Pause or limit non-Science hole-filling during designated Science time to protect Science instructional minutes.

3. **Administer a Science placement or diagnostic assessment within 5 school days.** MAP RIT 237 suggests Parker's Science knowledge may exceed platform-reported HMG of 6. A targeted diagnostic could unlock faster progression through grade 7 content and reduce redundant remediation.

4. **Set a 4-week checkpoint by March 14: complete MS Chemistry (104 XP remaining) and begin Physics.** This creates a measurable, time-bound milestone. If Parker cannot clear the remaining 104 XP in Chemistry within 4 weeks, escalate to a course-placement review.

5. **Conference with student and family within 10 school days to align on Science prioritization.** Clarify why Science engagement has been minimal and ensure the student understands the urgency of redirecting effort to the enrolled course before EOY.
