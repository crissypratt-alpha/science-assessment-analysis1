## SECTION 2 — Course Progress & Effort

### Table 2.1 — Course Progress

| % Complete | Total XP Earned | Total XP Remaining | Time in Course (days) | Avg XP / School Day |
|------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| 72% | MISSING | 690 (total MS Science) | 28 | MISSING |

**Notes**
- **% Complete**: 72% of MS Physics (current course). XP remaining in current course = 95 XP.
- **Total XP Remaining**: 690 XP to complete all middle school science (95 XP Physics + 240 XP Earth & Space Science + 355 XP Supplementary Course). Valentina has already completed Chemistry.
- **Time in Course (days)**: 28 unique school days with recorded test activity across all subjects (Aug 13 through Feb 4, 2026). Science-specific test days: 8 (Aug 14 ×4 placement tests, Dec 1, Dec 17, Dec 18).
- **Avg XP / School Day**: Explicit daily XP not provided. Daily XP target if science every other week = 20.3 XP; if daily = 10.1 XP.

## SECTION 3 — Assessment & Practice Signals

### Table 3.1 — Assessment & Practice

| Test Attempts | Last Test Date | Hole-Filling Attempts | Accuracy Trend | Fluency Signal |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 51 | 2026-02-04 | 30 | Improving | Not assessed |

**Notes**
- **Test Attempts**: 51 total test submissions across all subjects. Subject breakdown: Reading (12), Writing (7), Language (9), Math (8), Science (8), Vocabulary (5), Writing additional (2). Science = 8 of 51 (16%).
- **Science testing**:
  - Alpha Standardized Science G6.9 — 75% on Dec 1, 2025
  - Alpha Standardized Science G6.1 — 92% on Dec 17, 2025
  - Alpha Standardized Science G7.13 — 86% on Dec 18, 2025
- **Last Test Date**: 2026-02-04 (Language). Last Science-specific test: 2025-12-18.
- **Hole-Filling Attempts**: 30 of 51 tests (59%) were non-effective (Effective Test? = 0). Heavy hole-filling across Reading (8 of 12), Language (5 of 9), Math (6 of 8), Writing (4 of 7), and early Science placement tests (4 of 8).
- **Accuracy Trend**: Improving in Science. G6.9 = 75%, G6.1 = 92%, G7.13 = 86%. Valentina is the only student in the cohort to score above 80% on G7.13. Cross-subject accuracy also improving from early placement scores (38–53% in Math/Language on Sep 17) to recent 83–96% range.
- **Fluency Signal**: Not assessed. No fluency-specific data in any source file.

## SECTION 4 — Learning Velocity & Growth

### Table 4.1 — Growth Metrics

| Growth X | Expected Growth X | Meets 2× Target? | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| 5 (fall-to-winter) | 2.0 | Yes | Fall 2025-26 RIT 229 → Winter 2025-26 RIT 234 = 5-point gain vs. 1-point projected growth (5×). Winter-to-winter data not available (no Winter 2024-25 RIT in Predictions file). Predicted RIT was 239; actual is 234, underperforming by 5 points. Effective Grades Mastered = 2 this year (Section 1). |

## SECTION 5 — MAP Growth Context

### Table 5.1 — MAP Profile

| MAP Math RIT | MAP Grade Band | Domains Missed | Alignment Risk |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| MISSING | MISSING | MISSING | Low |

**Notes**
- **MAP Math RIT**: Valentina Melendez was not found in the MAP Scores file (MAP_ScoresEmail). Science RIT from Predictions file: Fall 229 → Winter 234 (5-point gain). Predicted RIT was 239; actual is 234, underperforming by 5 points.
- **MAP Grade Band**: Cannot be determined without MAP normative lookup. Winter Science RIT 234 for an 8th grader is approximately at or slightly above the national median.
- **Domains Missed**: No MAP domain/strand-level data available. MISSING.
- **Alignment Risk**: **Low**. Valentina demonstrates the strongest Science accuracy in the cohort — 86% on G7.13 (Section 3) — and has the most advanced course placement (already in Physics, having completed Chemistry). MAP growth is solid (5×). The platform mastery trajectory is broadly consistent with MAP performance. The main concern is pacing, not alignment.

## SECTION 6 — Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Root Cause

**Insufficient time on task**

### Secondary Root Cause

Coasting / low intensity

### Evidence

- Science receives only **16% of total test attempts** (8 of 51) — Section 3. Despite having the best Science accuracy in the cohort (86% on G7.13), Valentina is not translating this ability into proportional Science testing volume.
- **Last Science test was Dec 18, 2025** (Section 3) — nearly 2 months ago. Valentina has taken 13 tests since then (Language, Math, Vocabulary, Writing) but zero in Science, representing a significant engagement gap in the enrolled course.
- **59% of all tests are hole-filling** (Section 3). Heavy remediation in Reading, Math, and Language is consuming time that could accelerate Science progress, especially given Valentina's demonstrated Science competence.
- **Valentina is the only student to score above 80% on G7.13** (Section 3), yet she has not followed up on this strong result with additional Science testing. This pattern is consistent with coasting — the student has the ability to progress faster but is not being pushed or self-directing toward Science completion.
- With only **690 XP remaining** (Section 2) and a daily target of 10.1 XP (if Science were daily), this is the second-most achievable projection in the cohort (after Roarke Radia). The gap between ability/feasibility and actual pace underscores that effort intensity, not knowledge, is the constraint.

## SECTION 7 — Completion Projection

### Fixed Assumptions
- XP per day = **25**
- Days per week = **5**

### Table 7.1 — Projection

| XP Remaining | XP / Day Assumed | Days / Week | Weeks to Finish | Finish Before EOY? |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 690 | 25 | 5 | 6 | Yes |

**Calculation**
- Weeks to Finish = 690 ÷ (25 × 5) = 690 ÷ 125 = 5.52 → rounded **up** = **6 weeks**.
- 6 weeks from early February 2026 lands in approximately mid-March 2026 — well before EOY. Valentina has the strongest Science accuracy (86% on G7.13), has already completed Chemistry, and needs only 690 XP. At 25 XP/day, completion is highly achievable. Even at the every-other-week target of 20.3 XP/day, this remains feasible. Rated **Yes**.

## SECTION 8 — Intervention Levers

### Actions (maximum 5 bullets)

1. **Resume Science testing immediately (this week).** Valentina has not taken a Science test since Dec 18, 2025 — a nearly 2-month gap. With 86% accuracy on G7.13 and only 690 XP remaining, she is the best-positioned student in the cohort to finish MS Science. Schedule at least 3 Science tests per week.

2. **Set an aggressive but achievable completion target: finish MS Physics (95 XP) within 2 weeks by Feb 21.** Valentina is 72% through Physics with only 95 XP remaining. At 25 XP/day, this takes under 1 week of focused effort. Create accountability for this near-term milestone.

3. **Reduce cross-subject hole-filling during Science blocks (next 4 weeks).** 30 of 51 tests are hole-filling (59%) across Reading, Math, and Language. Valentina's Science ability far exceeds her other subjects' demands — protect Science time to capitalize on her strength.

4. **Conference with student within 5 school days to address the Science engagement gap.** Valentina has the ability (86% on G7.13) and a clear path (690 XP, 6 weeks). Determine why she stopped testing in Science for 2 months and establish a commitment to weekly Science testing minimums.

5. **Frame MS Science completion as a realistic, near-term milestone.** Valentina is one of only two students (with Roarke) who can realistically finish all MS Science by EOY. Make this visible — a countdown or progress tracker showing 690 XP to go can motivate sustained engagement.
