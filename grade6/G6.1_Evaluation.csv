There are three main categories of source regions: 1) Arctic; air masses occurring over arctic regions which are cold 2) Polar; air masses occurring away from the poles which are cold 3) Tropical; air masses occurring in the tropics which are hot Air masses are represented by 'c' for continental and 'm' for maritime, and the source regions are represented by 'A' for arctic, 'P' for polar. And 'T' for tropical. Each source region can also be either continental or maritime. To show this, category letters are usually combined. So, there are a total of six types of air masses: maritime arctic (mA), maritime polar (mP), maritime tropical (mT), continental arctic (cA), continental polar (cP), continental tropical (cT). Continental air mass in antarctic region is termed as continental antarctic and represented as cAA.

Air Masses Air mass is defined as the volume of air which can be either hot or cold and moist or dry depending on its water vapor content. Air masses control the weather of a region. The two main categories of air masses are continental and maritime. An air mass found over land is called continental and one found over water is called maritime. Air over continents are dry and air over oceans are moist (or wet).",,6,,2,Visual provided but limited scenario context. Somewhat guided.,1,No science practice engaged.
