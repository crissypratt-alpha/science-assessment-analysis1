Alpha Standardized Science G6.15,2,"Alpha Standardized Science G6.15 Created By STC 11 1 Two students notice how quickly their cups of hot chocolate cool off. The students ask an adult to boil water. The water is 100 degrees Celsius (°C) when the adult pours it into a cup. The air temperature in the room is 20°C. After 10 minutes, the students note that the water temperature is 30°C. Explain the students’ observations by completing the sentence below: Over time, the a energy of the water b because energy flows from c matter. a b c chemical stays the same warmer to cooler thermal decreases cooler to warmer increases Rats were accidentally introduced onto an island in the Pacific Ocean in the 1940s. The rat population grew rapidly as the rats fed on eggs and small animals, as well as seeds and tree seedlings. In 2011, wildlife workers removed all rats from the island. The graphs show data for two tree species, before and after the removal of the rats. How can these data BEST be evaluated to compare solutions to the problems faced by native tree species?",Diagram/image referenced in question,MC,"A) Putting both graphs on the same scale would show that removing rats has aided population growth of native trees more than of non-native trees., B) Comparing the data and graphs shows that removing rats has had a negative effect on small animals because rat removal decreased food sources., C) Putting both graphs on the same scale would show that controlling non-native tree population growth is needed in addition to rat removal., D) Comparing the data and graphs shows that controlling the number of small animals is needed in addition to rat removal. Use the information to answer question 3. The Nile River The Nile River floods every year. Most of the river passes through the Sahara Desert, where there is little rain, resulting in seasonal periods of drought and flooding. One section of the river, called the Blue Nile, gets water from heavy summer rains that cause flooding in the area. This water flows north and causes floods along the rest of the river. When a dam is built on a river, a large body of water called a reservoir forms. Reservoirs can hold a lot of water to prevent floods, but they can also supply water in times of drought. Dams significantly change the way water and sediment flow down a river. Dams control the flow of water down a river and can be used to generate electricity. The Aswan High Dam in Egypt was completed in 1970. In 2011, work began on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Flooding along the Nile River depends strongly on rainfall in Ethiopia. This rainfall varies from year to year and from month to month.
