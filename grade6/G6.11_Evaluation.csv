Alpha Standardized Science G6.11,25,"sponge wall, that electrical energy was transformed to light energy. Sarah was riding her skateboard down a smooth sidewalk. As she approached a patch of small pebbles, she noticed her skateboard moving slower and eventually coming to a stop after rolling over the pebbles. Later, when she touched the pebbles, she noticed they felt slightly warm. Which observation best supports the claim that energy was transferred from Sarah's moving skateboard?",None,MC,"A) The pebbles felt warm after the skateboard rolled over them., B) The skateboard was moving in a straight line before hitting the pebbles., C) Some pebbles moved slightly from their original position., D) Sarah maintained her balance throughout the ride.
