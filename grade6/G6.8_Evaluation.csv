Alpha Standardized Science G6.8_v2,6,Select the ONE TRUE statement about the behavior of particles in a solid:,None,MC,"A) period known as the Great Drought occurred from A.D. 1276 through 1299. Scientists suggest that this drought may explain why the Anasazi suddenly left their communities. Scientists have collected evidence of the drought by studying tree rings. Trees produce growth rings during annual growing seasons. The widths of the annual rings depend on the available precipitation and average temperatures. Table 1 shows evidence collected from tree ring studies. These studies show how the West was affected by droughts from A.D. 850 through 1400. In years with normal precipitation levels, 38 percent of the West was affected by droughts. Drier years occurred when more than 38 percent of the West was affected by droughts.

At this speed, how far will the goldfish swim in 2.5 seconds? Write your answer as a whole number. centimeters Use the information about the Anasazi and the Great Drought and your knowledge of science to answer the questions. The Anasazi and the Great Drought The Anasazi were a Native American people who settled areas that are now known as Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah. Evidence suggests that the Anasazi suddenly moved from their settlements in about A.D. 1300. Scientists have recently looked at what may have caused the Anasazi to move and relocate much farther south in Arizona and New Mexico. The Anasazi set up complex farming communities in the years A.D. 100 through 1300. They built irrigation structures such as reservoirs, stone dams, and low stone walls. These structures helped the Anasazi store and use water for their crops. The Anasazi primarily raised corn, beans, and domesticated turkeys.
