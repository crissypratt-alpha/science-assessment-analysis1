The four major systems of Earth and various processes are also shown in his model. While sunlight is the driving force of the water cycle, the greatest force propelling the water cycle is gravity. Gravity is the force of attraction between two objects. The gravity exerted by Earth’s pulls things down, toward its center. Which statement, based on the model the student made, is true?, B) predatory: the bee is a predator which consumes the flower, C) parasitic: the bee is a parasite, harming the flower when it takes the flower's pollen, D) mutually beneficial: the bee receives pollen and the flower gets help with its reproduction Answer the following questions after reading this passage.
