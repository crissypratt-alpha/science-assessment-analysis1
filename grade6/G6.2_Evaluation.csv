The widths of the annual rings depend on the available precipitation and average temperatures. Table 1 shows evidence collected from tree ring studies.

Seasons The Earth orbits the Sun on its axis, which is tilted. As the Earth revolves around the Sun, because the Earth's axis is tilted, different amounts of sunlight are received in the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth and the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth. This change in the amounts of sunlight received causes the four seasons. At the time when one hemisphere experiences summer, the other hemisphere experiences winter. This is due to the fact that the light received by one half of the Earth is more than the light received by the other half. Equinoxes occur when both hemispheres receive the same amount of sunlight.

The next two questions are based on the following passage. Balanced and Unbalanced Forces At any point in time, there are usually multiple forces that are simultaneously acting on an object. When the forces that are acting on an object are equally strong but opposite in direction, the forces balance each other out. However, when the force that is acting on an object from one side or direction is stronger than the force from the other side or direction, the forces are said to be unbalanced. Unbalanced forces are what cause change. Think of the balance of forces like a game of tug of war. If one side pulls harder than the other, the rope will pull in the direction of the stronger team. If the teams are equally balanced in strength, the rope will hold still between the two teams. Balanced and unbalanced forces impact the rate and the direction of the motion of objects. Balanced forces are forces that are equal in strength. Therefore, they do not cause an object's motion to change. If an object is moving when it is subjected to balanced forces, it will continue moving in the same direction at the same pace. On the other hand, if the object is motionless when it is subjected to balanced forces, it will remain still. Balanced forces are equal to and opposite of one another. They have a net force of zero. Net force is the combination of all of the forces that are acting on an object. Again, this means that balanced forces are even and cancel each other out. Unlike balanced forces, unbalanced forces bring change to the motion of an object. If an object is in motion, unbalanced forces will change the speed or direction of its travel. If the object is at rest, they will make the motionless object begin to move. The net force for an unbalanced force is never zero. For example, if there are 6 newtons (N) of force being applied to the right side of an object and 3 N being applied from the left, the net force of the unbalanced forces is 3 N from the right. 6 N right + (-3 N) right = 3 N right Unbalanced forces can impact an object in motion in several different ways. They can make the object speed up, slow down, or change directions. If the net force is applied in the same direction in which the object is moving, the object will speed up. This is because the forces are working together as they push or pull in the same direction. The net force of forces that are working together is equal to the sum of the two forces. If the net force is applied in the opposite direction of the way the object is moving, the object will slow down or stop. The two forces are considered to be opposite forces when they push or pull in different directions. The net force of opposite forces is the difference of the two forces. The resultant is the final amount of force that is applied to an object. If there is an object with balanced forces on it what will happen to that object?",,6,,1,Minimal or no scenario.

A front is used to describe the boundary between warm and cold air masses. A warm front is a warm air mass that comes into a region with an existing cold air mass. This can cause fog, increased rainfall and even thunderstorms as the warm air rises above the cold air. A cold front is a cold air mass that enters the region occupied by a warm air mass. Similar weather conditions persist, however when cold air comes in to the warm air mass, the reaction happens faster as the cold air forces the warm air up. This can lead to more violent weather conditions such as quick drops in temperature, heavy rain and winds. In region A, a warm and moist air mass slides over a cold air mass. In region B, a cold air mass pushes the warm air mass to rise. Match the weather conditions in response to the air masses near region A and B. A B DRAG & DROP THE ANSWER Cold air mass would push the warm air mass upward producing thunderstorms. Warm air would condense to form clouds followed by gentle rain.

Alpha Standardized Science G6.2,36,The mountain ranges found in Argentina in South America and Ghana in Africa have the same age and rock strata. The shapes of the two continents seem to fit into each other like two puzzle pieces when lined up next to one another. What can be concluded from this evidence?,None,MC,"A) that the two continents have coastlines with similar climates, B) that the mountain ranges on the two continents have the same elevation, C) that the mountain ranges on the two continents were formed at the same time, D) that the two continents were once connected but their plates later drifted apart Answer the following questions after reading this passage. The Forces That Change Earth's Surface Earth's surface keeps changing due to various forces, including wind, water, ice, volcanic activity, and earthquakes. These forces can be categorized into two types based on the speed at which they change the Earth's surface: fast change and slow change. Fast changes occur immediately, like during an earthquake where the movement of the Earth's plates suddenly alters the surface. Volcanic eruptions are another example of fast change, as they can rapidly transform the landscape by producing thick layers of rock on the land. On the other hand, slow changes take place over an extended period. The formation of mountains is an example of a slow change, often resulting from the gradual collision of tectonic plates over millions of years. Wind is another force that can create slow changes. Through a process called sandblasting, wind blows sand against rocks, eroding and shaping them into unusual formations over time. In summary, Earth's surface is constantly being reshaped by a combination of fast and slow processes. Volcanoes and earthquakes represent fast changes, while plate movements and wind erosion exemplify slow changes that occur over lengthy timescales. 37 Label these images based on the processes that caused them.
